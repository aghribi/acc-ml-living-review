Multi-scale methods,\nbalancing between a coarse approximation of the fields at the scale of the\nmagnet and a detailed description at the scale of the conductors, are promising\napproaches to reduce the computational load while keeping a sufficient\naccuracy. In this work, we introduce a neural network approach to accelerate\nmulti-scale magneto-thermal simulations of LTS magnets by replacing costly\nsingle-turn FE models with neural network surrogates. The neural network\narchitecture is presented and discussed, together with an automated procedure\nfor generating simulation data for its training. The resulting accelerated\nmulti-scale model is used to simulate current ramp-up procedures for the IBA\nS2C2 magnet. The surrogate-based multi-scale model is compared with a\nconventional multi-scale model based on a composite wire-in-channel FE model.\nThe surrogate model is shown to reproduce single-turn filament hysteresis,\ninter-filament coupling, and eddy losses, while the computational time of the\nmulti-scale method is reduced by a factor of 800.",

Some of the existing learning algorithms\ncannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the\ninstability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the\nAccelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and\nmore stable model, interacts with the environment independently while\nsimultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the\nfirst stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained\ntransformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.\nAs a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of\nits performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.\nBy conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill\nenvironments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show\nthat applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers\nbut also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of\ntwo. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy\nmethods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational\ndemands.",

However,\nexisting deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental\nconditions.

This probe-centric approach enables a single\nphysics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across\nmultiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe\ngeneralization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution\nlearning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction\nfidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even\nwhen changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach\nenables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback\nunder dynamic experimental conditions.",

      "abstract": "In magnetically confined fusion device, the complex, multiscale, and\nnonlinear dynamics of plasmas necessitate the integration of extensive\ndiagnostic systems to effectively monitor and control plasma behaviour. The\ncomplexity and uncertainty arising from these extensive systems and their\ntangled interrelations has long posed a significant obstacle to the\nacceleration of fusion energy development. In this work, a large-scale model,\nfusion masked auto-encoder (FusionMAE) is pre-trained to compress the\ninformation from 88 diagnostic signals into a concrete embedding, to provide a\nunified interface between diagnostic systems and control actuators. Two\nmechanisms are proposed to ensure a meaningful embedding: compression-reduction\nand missing-signal reconstruction. Upon completion of pre-training, the model\nacquires the capability for 'virtual backup diagnosis', enabling the inference\nof missing diagnostic data with 96.7% reliability. Furthermore, the model\ndemonstrates three emergent capabilities: automatic data analysis, universal\ncontrol-diagnosis interface, and enhancement of control performance on multiple\ntasks. This work pioneers large-scale AI model integration in fusion energy,\ndemonstrating how pre-trained embeddings can simplify the system interface,\nreducing necessary diagnostic systems and optimize operation performance for\nfuture fusion reactors.",

In this work, a surrogate model based on a\nfully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict the\nspace-time current density distribution in REBCO solenoids. Training datasets\nwere generated from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes.\nThe results demonstrate that, for deeper networks, the FCRN architecture\nachieves better convergence than conventional fully connected network (FCN),\nwith the configuration of 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer\nproviding the most favorable balance between training accuracy and\ngeneralization capability. Extrapolation studies show that the model can\nreliably predict magnetization losses for up to 50% beyond the training range,\nwith maximum errors below 10%. The surrogate model achieves predictions several\norders of magnitude faster than FEM and still remains advantageous when\ntraining costs are included. These results indicate that the proposed\nFCRN-based surrogate model provides both accuracy and efficiency, offering a\npromising tool for the rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.",

Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across\ndifferent materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet\ncomputationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF\nengineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine\nlearning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar\ngeometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary\nelectron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -\nincluding Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting\n(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the\ntime-averaged electron growth rate, ${\\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated\nusing Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and\nPearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs\nin generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a\nscalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian\nhyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those\ntrained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis\nreveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint\nfeature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset\ncoverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based\nmultipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven\nmodeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.",

      "abstract": "As scientific facilities transition toward high-throughput, data-intensive\nexperiments, there is a growing need for real-time computing at the edge to\nsupport autonomous decision-making and minimize data transmission bottlenecks.\nDepartment of Energy (DOE) initiatives emphasize the development of\nheterogeneous computing architectures that integrate machine learning (ML)\nmodels with specialized hardware such as FPGAs, GPUs, and embedded systems to\nmeet the demands of next-generation experiments. These advances are critical\nfor facilities such as X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), where\nhigh-repetition-rate experiments produce terabyte-scale datasets, requiring\nreal-time analysis and control.\n  To address this challenge, we introduce DCIFR, a deep learning framework\noptimized for edge processing and high-speed X-ray diagnostics at SLAC's Linac\nCoherent Light Source (LCLS). DCIFR leverages a hybrid neural architecture,\ncombining convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional long short-term\nmemory (BiLSTM) networks, and residual neural networks (ResNets) to denoise\nsinograms, classify X-ray sub-spikes, and extract phase separation with\nattosecond precision. The model achieves a phase extraction accuracy of 0.04652\nradians (29.6 attoseconds at 1.2 um streaking wavelength) with inference\nlatencies of 168.3 us and throughput exceeding 10kHz. Designed for deployment\non heterogeneous architectures, DCIFR reduces computational overhead and\nsupports future AI-driven feedback loops for ultrafast experiments. This work\ndemonstrates the potential of edge AI and hardware acceleration to drive\nscalable, autonomous data analysis in next-generation DOE scientific\nfacilities.",

      "abstract": "The commissioning and operation of future large-scale scientific experiments\nwill challenge current tuning and control methods. Reinforcement learning (RL)\nalgorithms are a promising solution thanks to their capability of autonomously\ntackling a control problem based on a task parameterized by a reward function.\nThe conventionally utilized machine learning (ML) libraries are not intended\nfor microsecond latency applications, as they mostly optimize for throughput\nperformance. On the other hand, most of the programmable logic implementations\nare meant for computation acceleration, not being intended to work in a\nreal-time environment. To overcome these limitations of current\nimplementations, RL needs to be deployed on-the-edge, i.e. on to the device\ngathering the training data. In this paper we present the design and deployment\nof an experience accumulator system in a particle accelerator. In this system\ndeep-RL algorithms run using hardware acceleration and act within a few\nmicroseconds, enabling the use of RL for control of ultra-fast phenomena. The\ntraining is performed offline to reduce the number of operations carried out on\nthe acceleration hardware. The proposed architecture was tested in real\nexperimental conditions at the Karlsruhe research accelerator (KARA), serving\nalso as a synchrotron light source, where the system was used to control\ninduced horizontal betatron oscillations in real-time. The results showed a\nperformance comparable to the commercial feedback system available at the\naccelerator, proving the viability and potential of this approach. Due to the\nself-learning and reconfiguration capability of this implementation, its\nseamless application to other control problems is possible.

Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict\nthe phase(s), low density, and high radiation length of the designed Al-Ti-V\nalloys. Al-Ti-V alloys with various compositions for single-phase and\ndual-phase mixtures, liquidus temperature, and density values are obtained\nusing the Latin hypercube sampling method in TC Python Thermo-Calc software.\nThe obtained dataset is utilized to train the machine-learning algorithms.\nClassification algorithms such as XGBoost and regression models such as Linear\nRegression and Random Forest regressor have been used to compute the number of\nphases, radiation length, and density respectively. The XGBoost algorithms show\nan accuracy of $98\\%$, the Linear regression model shows an accuracy of $94\\%$,\nand the Random Forest regressor model is accurate up to $99\\%$. The developed\nAl-Ti-V alloys exhibit high radiation length as well as a good combination of\nhigh elastic modulus and toughness due to the synergistic effect of the\npresence of hard $Al_3Ti$ phase along with a minor volume fraction of FCC\n$(Al)_{ss}$ solid solution phase mixture. The comparison of our alloys, alloy-1\n($Al_{75.2}Ti_{22.8}V_{2}$) and alloy-2 ($Al_{89}Ti_{10}V_{1}$) shows an\nincrease in the radiation length by seven-times and a decrease in the density\nby two to three times as compared to stainless steel 304, the preferred\nmaterial for constructing beampipes in low-energy particle accelerators.\nFurther, we experimentally verify the elastic modulus of the alloy-1 and\ncompute the FoM equal to 0.416, which is better than other existing materials\nfor beampipes in low-energy experiments.",

Beam Steering is an essential\ntask for light sources. The Linac To Undulator is very difficult to steer and\naim due to the changes of each use of the accelerator there must be\nre-calibration of magnets. However with each use of the Beamline its current\nmethod of steering runs into issues when faced with calibrating angles and\npositions. Human operators spend a substantial amount of time and resources on\nthe task. We developed multiple different feed-forward-neural networks with\nvarying hyper-parameters, inputs, and outputs, seeking to compare their\nperformance. Specifically, our smaller models with 33 inputs and 13 outputs\noutperformed the larger models with 73 inputs and 50 outputs. We propose the\nfollowing explanations for this lack of performance in larger models. First, a\nlack of training time and computational power limited the ability of our models\nto mature. Given more time, our models would outperform SVD. Second, when the\ninput size of the model increases the noise increases as well. In this case\nmore inputs corresponded to a greater length upon the LINAC accelerator. Less\nspecific and larger models that seek to make more predictions will inherently\nperform worse than SVD.",

In this study, we apply\nthe DLMN to the SIS18 hadron synchrotron at GSI for the first time.\n  We discuss the validity of the recovered linear and non-linear optics,\nincluding quadrupole and sextupole errors, and compare our results with\nalternative methods, such as the LOCO fit of a measured orbit response matrix\nand the evaluation of resonance driving terms. The small number of required\ntrajectory measurements, one for linear and three for non-linear optics\nreconstruction, demonstrates the method's time efficiency. Our findings\nindicate that the DLMN is well-suited for identifying linear optics, and the\nrecovery of non-linear optics is achievable within the capabilities of the\ncurrent beam position monitor system. We demonstrate the application of DLMN\nresults through simulated resonance diagrams in tune space and their comparison\nwith measurements.

A key challenge with autonomous accelerator\ntuning remains that the most capable algorithms require an expert in\noptimisation, machine learning or a similar field to implement the algorithm\nfor every new tuning task. In this work, we propose the use of large language\nmodels (LLMs) to tune particle accelerators. We demonstrate on a\nproof-of-principle example the ability of LLMs to successfully and autonomously\ntune a particle accelerator subsystem based on nothing more than a natural\nlanguage prompt from the operator, and compare the performance of our LLM-based\nsolution to state-of-the-art optimisation algorithms, such as Bayesian\noptimisation (BO) and reinforcement learning-trained optimisation (RLO). In\ndoing so, we also show how LLMs can perform numerical optimisation of a highly\nnon-linear real-world objective function. Ultimately, this work represents yet\nanother complex task that LLMs are capable of solving and promises to help\naccelerate the deployment of autonomous tuning algorithms to the day-to-day\noperations of particle accelerators.",

Beam-tuning experiments are performed at\nthe KEK $e^-$/$e^+$ injector Linac to maximize the electron-beam charge and\nreduce the energy-dispersion function. In each case, the performance achieved\nis comparable to that of a skilled expert.",

In many complex engineering systems, such as\nparticle accelerators, labels are sparse and expensive; in order to perform\nanomaly detection in these cases, we must drop these assumptions and utilize a\ncompletely unsupervised method. This paper introduces the Resilient Variational\nAutoencoder (ResVAE), a deep generative model specifically designed for anomaly\ndetection. ResVAE exhibits resilience to anomalies present in the training data\nand provides feature-level anomaly attribution. During the training process,\nResVAE learns the anomaly probability for each sample as well as each\nindividual feature, utilizing these probabilities to effectively disregard\nanomalous examples in the training data. We apply our proposed method to detect\nanomalies in the accelerator status at the SLAC Linac Coherent Light Source\n(LCLS). By utilizing shot-to-shot data from the beam position monitoring\nsystem, we demonstrate the exceptional capability of ResVAE in identifying\nvarious types of anomalies that are visible in the accelerator.",

Combining deep neural networks with Gaussian process\napproximation techniques have shown promising results, but dimensionality\nreduction through standard deep neural network layers is not guaranteed to\nmaintain the distance information necessary for Gaussian process models. We\nbuild on previous work by comparing the use of the singular value decomposition\nagainst a spectral-normalized dense layer as a feature extractor for a deep\nneural Gaussian process approximation model and apply it to a capacitance\nprediction problem for the High Voltage Converter Modulators in the Oak Ridge\nSpallation Neutron Source. Our model shows improved distance preservation and\npredicts in-distribution capacitance values with less than 1% error.",

The model is formulated as logistic\nregression penalized by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, based\non a statistical two sample test to distinguish between unstable and stable\nstates of the accelerator.\n  The primary objective for receiving alarms prior to interlocks is to allow\nfor countermeasures and reduce beam time loss. Hence, a continuous evaluation\nmetric is developed to measure the saved beam time in any period, given the\nassumption that interlocks could be circumvented by reducing the beam current.\nThe best-performing interlock-to-stable classifier can potentially increase the\nbeam time by around 5 min in a day. Possible instrumentation for fast\nadjustment of the beam current is also listed and discussed.",

This reduces the quantity and quality of information\ngained from experimental measurements, in a system where measurements have a\nlimited availability. However differentiable physics modeling, combined with\nmachine learning techniques, can overcome these analysis limitations, enabling\naccurate, detailed model creation of physical accelerators. Here we examine two\napplications of differentiable modeling, first to characterize beam responses\nto accelerator elements exhibiting hysteretic behavior, and second to\ncharacterize beam distributions in high dimensional phase spaces.",

The design and\noptimization of these devices can be lengthy due to the need to repeatedly\nperform high-fidelity simulations. Several recent papers have demonstrated that\nmachine learning can be used to build surrogate models (fast-executing\nreplacements of computationally costly beam simulations) for order-of-magnitude\ncomputing time speedups. However, while these pilot studies are encouraging,\nthere is room to improve their predictive accuracy. Particularly, beam summary\nstatistics such as emittances (an important figure of merit in particle\naccelerator physics) have historically been challenging to predict. For the\nfirst time, we present a surrogate model trained on 200,000 samples that yields\n<6% mean average percent error for the predictions of all relevant beam output\nparameters, solving the problem of poor emittance predictions by identifying\nand including hidden variables which were not accounted for previously. These\nsurrogate models were made possible by using the Julia language and GPU\ncomputing; we briefly discuss both. We demonstrate the utility of surrogate\nmodeling by performing a multi-objective optimization using our best model as a\ncallback in the objective function to select an optimal RFQ design. We consider\ntrade-offs in RFQ performance for various choices of Pareto-optimal design\nvariables: common issues for any multi-objective optimization scheme. Lastly,\nwe make recommendations for input data preparation, selection, and neural\nnetwork architectures that pave the way for future development of\nproduction-capable surrogate models for RFQs and other particle accelerators.",

Nine\ndifferent machine learning techniques based on ensemble trees, convolutional\nneural networks, support vector machines, and hierarchical voting ensembles are\nproposed to detect the fault precursors. Although all 9 models have shown a\nperfect and identical performance during the training and testing phase, the\nperformance of most models has decreased in the prognosis phase once they got\nexposed to real-world data from the 21 experiments. The hierarchical voting\nensemble, which features multiple layers of diverse models, maintains a\ndistinguished performance in early detection of the fault precursors with 95%\nsuccess rate (20/21 tests), followed by adaboost and extremely randomized trees\nwith 52% and 48% success rates, respectively. The support vector machine models\nwere the worst with only 24% success rate (5/21 tests). The study concluded\nthat a successful implementation of machine learning in the SNS or particle\naccelerator power systems would require a major upgrade in the controller and\nthe data acquisition system to facilitate streaming and handling big data for\nthe machine learning models. In addition, this study shows that the best\nperforming models were diverse and based on the ensemble concept to reduce the\nbias and hyperparameter sensitivity of individual models.",

Extraction of this information is\nan intricate process, however. To demonstrate how to approach this challenge\nwith modern methods, this paper utilizes data from simulated plasma wakefield\nacceleration-derived betatron radiation experiments and high-field\nlaser-electron-based radiation production to determine reliable methods of\nreconstructing key beam and interaction properties. For these measurements,\nrecovering the emitted 200 keV to 10 GeV photon energy spectra from two\nadvanced spectrometers now being commissioned requires testing multiple methods\nto finalize a pipeline from their responses to incident electron beam\ninformation. In each case, we compare the performance of: neural networks,\nwhich detect patterns between data sets through repeated training; maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE), a statistical technique used to determine unknown\nparameters from the distribution of observed data; and a hybrid approach\ncombining the two. Further, in the case of photons with energies above 30 MeV,\nwe also examine the efficacy of QR decomposition, a matrix decomposition\nmethod. The betatron radiation and the high-energy photon cases demonstrate the\neffectiveness of a hybrid ML-MLE approach, while the high-field electrodynamics\ninteraction and the low-energy photon cases showcased the machine learning (ML)\nmodel's efficiency in the presence of noise. As such, while there is utility in\nall the methods, the ML-MLE hybrid approach proves to be the most\ngeneralizable.",

To meet the needs of these applications, accelerator\nphysicists rely heavily on detailed simulations of the complicated particle\nbeam dynamics through the accelerator. One of the most computationally\nexpensive and difficult-to-model effects is the impact of Coherent Synchrotron\nRadiation (CSR). As a beam travels through a curved trajectory (e.g. due to a\nbending magnet), it emits radiation that in turn interacts with the rest of the\nbeam. At each step through the trajectory, the electromagnetic field introduced\nby CSR (called the CSR wakefield) needs to computed and used when calculating\nthe updates to the positions and momenta of every particle in the beam. CSR is\none of the major drivers of growth in the beam emittance, which is a key metric\nof beam quality that is critical in many applications. The CSR wakefield is\nvery computationally intensive to compute with traditional electromagnetic\nsolvers, and this is a major limitation in accurately simulating accelerators.\nHere, we demonstrate a new approach for the CSR wakefield computation using a\nneural network solver structured in a way that is readily generalizable to new\nsetups.

Shorter more intense bunches are also more difficult to\naccurately image because their dimensions are beyond the resolution of existing\ndiagnostics and they may be destructive to intercepting diagnostics. The\nlimited availability of detailed diagnostics for intense high energy beams is a\nfundamental challenge for the accelerator community because both beams and\naccelerators are time-varying systems that change in unpredictable ways. The\ndetailed 6D (x,y,z,px,py,pz) distributions of beams emerging from sources vary\nwith time due to factors such as evolving photocathode laser intensity profiles\nand the quantum efficiency of photocathodes. Accelerator magnets, RF\namplifiers, and control systems are perturbed by external disturbances,\nbeam-loading effects, temperature variations, and misalignments. Although\nmachine learning (ML) methods have grown in popularity in the accelerator\ncommunity in recently years, they are fundamentally limited when it comes to\ntime-varying systems for which most current approaches are to simply collect\nlarge new data sets and perform re-training, something which is not feasible\nfor busy accelerator user facilities because detailed beam measurements usually\ninterrupt operations. New adaptive machine learning (AML) methods designed for\ntime-varying systems are needed to aid in the diagnostics and control of\nhigh-intensity, ultrashort beams by combining deep learning tools such as\nconvolutional neural network-based encoder-decoder architectures,\nmodel-independent feedback, physics constraints, and online models with real\ntime non-invasive beam data, to provide a detailed virtual view of intense\nbunch dynamics.",

These efforts have\nranged from the analysis of quenches in radio frequency cavities and\nsuperconducting magnets to anomalous beam position monitors, and even losses in\nrings. Using machine learning for anomaly detection can be challenging owing to\nthe inherent imbalance in the amount of data collected during normal operations\nas compared to during faults. Additionally, the data are not always labeled and\ntherefore supervised learning is not possible. Autoencoders, neural networks\nthat form a compressed representation and reconstruction of the input data, are\na useful tool for such situations.

Since surrogate models execute orders of magnitude\nfaster than corresponding physics beam dynamics simulations using standard\ntools like PARMTEQM and RFQGen, the computational complexity of the\nmulti-objective optimization problem reduces significantly. Ultimately, this\npresents a computationally inexpensive and time efficient method to perform\nsensitivity studies and an optimization of the crucial RFQ beam output\nparameters like transmission and emittances. Two different methods of surrogate\nmodel creation (polynomial chaos expansion and neural networks) are discussed\nand the achieved model accuracy is evaluated for different study cases with\ngradually increasing complexity, ranging from a simple FODO cell example to the\nfull RFQ optimization. We find that variations of the beam input Twiss\nparameters can be reproduced well. The prediction of the beam with respect to\nhardware changes, e.g. of the electrode modulation, are challenging on the\nother hand. We discuss possible reasons.",

Efficient control of\nthe RFQ resonance frequency detuning still remains a challenge because the\ntemperature-sensitive frequency is solely control by a cooling water system,\nexhibiting complicated transport delay and nonlinearity in the heat transfer\nprocesses. In this work, we propose a long-short term memory (LSTM)-based\nKoopman network model that can simultaneously learn the time-delayed and\nnon-delayed correlations hidden in the historical operating data. It is proven\nthat the model can effectively predict the behavior of the RFQ resonance\nfrequency using historical data as inputs.

We demonstrate that the MPC framework utilizing deep learning model is\nable to provide precise and rapid control for the RFQ frequency detuning,\nreducing the control time by half compared to the\nproportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.",

For time-varying systems the\npredictive capabilities of ML tools degrade as the systems are no longer\naccurately represented by the data sets with which the ML models were trained.\nRe-training is possible, but only if the changes are slow and if new\ninput-output training data measurements can be made online non-invasively. In\nthis work we present an approach to deep learning for time-varying systems in\nwhich adaptive feedback based only on available system output measurements is\napplied to encoded low-dimensional dense layers of encoder-decoder type CNNs.\nWe demonstrate our method in developing an inverse model of a complex charged\nparticle accelerator system, mapping output beam measurements to input beam\ndistributions while both the accelerator components and the unknown input beam\ndistribution quickly vary with time. We demonstrate our results using\nexperimental measurements of the input and output beam distributions of the\nHiRES ultra-fast electron diffraction (UED) microscopy beam line at Lawrence\nBerkeley National Laboratory. We show how our method can be used to aid both\nphysics and ML-based surrogate online models to provide non-invasive beam\ndiagnostics and we also demonstrate how our method can be used to automatically\ntrack the time varying quantum efficiency map of a particle accelerator's\nphotocathode.",

      "abstract": "Anomalies in radio-frequency (RF) stations can result in unplanned downtime\nand performance degradation in linear accelerators such as SLAC's Linac\nCoherent Light Source (LCLS). Detecting these anomalies is challenging due to\nthe complexity of accelerator systems, high data volume, and scarcity of\nlabeled fault data. Prior work identified faults using beam-based detection,\ncombining RF amplitude and beam-position monitor data. Due to the simplicity of\nthe RF amplitude data, classical methods are sufficient to identify faults, but\nthe recall is constrained by the low-frequency and asynchronous characteristics\nof the data. In this work, we leverage high-frequency, time-synchronous RF\nphase data to enhance anomaly detection in the LCLS accelerator. Due to the\ncomplexity of phase data, classical methods fail, and we instead train deep\nneural networks within the Coincident Anomaly Detection (CoAD) framework. We\nfind that applying CoAD to phase data detects nearly three times as many\nanomalies as when applied to amplitude data, while achieving broader coverage\nacross RF stations. Furthermore, the rich structure of phase data enables us to\ncluster anomalies into distinct physical categories. Through the integration of\nauxiliary system status bits, we link clusters to specific fault signatures,\nproviding additional granularity for uncovering the root cause of faults. We\nalso investigate interpretability via Shapley values, confirming that the\nlearned models focus on the most informative regions of the data and providing\ninsight for cases where the model makes mistakes. This work demonstrates that\nphase-based anomaly detection for RF stations improves both diagnostic coverage\nand root cause analysis in accelerator systems and that deep neural networks\nare essential for effective analysis.",

In this work, we examine incorporating prior\naccelerator physics information into Bayesian optimization algorithms by\nutilizing fast executing, neural network models trained on simulated or\nhistorical datasets as prior mean functions in Gaussian process models. We show\nthat in ideal cases, this technique substantially increases convergence speed\nto optimal solutions in high-dimensional tuning parameter spaces. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate that even in non-ideal cases, where prior models of beam\ndynamics do not exactly match experimental conditions, the use of this\ntechnique can still enhance convergence speed. Finally, we demonstrate how\nthese methods can be used to improve optimization in practical applications,\nsuch as transferring information gained from beam dynamics simulations to\nonline control of the LCLS injector, and transferring knowledge gained from\nexperimental measurements across different operating modes, such as\naccelerating different ion species at the ATLAS heavy ion accelerator.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic aperture is an important concept for the study of non-linear beam\ndynamics in circular accelerators. It describes the extent of the phase-space\nregion where a particle's motion remains bounded over a given number of turns.\nUnderstanding the features of dynamic aperture is crucial for the design and\noperation of such accelerators, as it provides insights into nonlinear effects\nand the possibility of optimising beam lifetime. The standard approach to\ncalculate the dynamic aperture requires numerical simulations of several\ninitial conditions densely distributed in phase space for a sufficient number\nof turns to probe the time scale corresponding to machine operations. This\nprocess is very computationally intensive and practically outside the range of\ntoday's computers. In our study, we introduced a novel method to estimate\ndynamic aperture rapidly and accurately by utilising a Deep Neural Network\nmodel. This model was trained with simulated tracking data from the CERN Large\nHadron Collider and takes into account variations in accelerator parameters\nsuch as betatron tune, chromaticity, and the strength of the Landau octupoles.\nTo enhance its performance, we integrate the model into an innovative Active\nLearning framework. This framework not only enables retraining and updating of\nthe computed model, but also facilitates efficient data generation through\nsmart sampling. Since chaotic motion cannot be predicted, traditional tracking\nsimulations are incorporated into the Active Learning framework to deal with\nthe chaotic nature of some initial conditions. The results demonstrate that the\nuse of the Active Learning framework allows faster scanning of the\nconfiguration parameters without compromising the accuracy of the dynamic\naperture estimates.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning models of accelerator systems (`surrogate models') are able\nto provide fast, accurate predictions of accelerator physics phenomena.\nHowever, approaches to date typically do not include measured input\ndiagnostics, such as the initial beam distributions, which are critical for\naccurately representing the beam evolution through the system. In addition,\nthese inputs often vary over time, and models that can account for these\nchanging conditions are needed. Simulations are in some cases needed to provide\nsufficient training data. These typically represent the designed machine before\nconstruction; however, the behavior of the installed components may be quite\ndifferent due to changes over time or static differences that were not modeled.\nTherefore, surrogate models that can leverage both simulation and measured data\nsuccessfully are needed. We introduce an approach based on convolutional neural\nnetworks that uses the drive laser distribution and scalar settings as inputs\nfor the Linac Coherent Light Source II injector frontend. The model is able to\npredict scalar beam parameters and the transverse beam distribution downstream,\ntaking into account the impact of time-varying non-uniformities in the initial\ntransverse laser distribution. We also introduce and evaluate a transfer\nlearning procedure for adapting the surrogate model from the simulation domain\nto the measurement domain, to account for differences between the two. Applying\nthis approach to our test case results in a model that can predict test sample\noutputs within a mean absolute percent error of 7.6%. This is a substantial\nimprovement over the model trained only on simulations, which has an error of\n112.7% when applied to measured data. While we focus on the LCLS-II Injector\nfrontend, these approaches for improving ML-based online modeling of injector\nsystems could be easily adapted to other accelerator facilities.",

In order to conduct the experiments, the authors designed and\nimplemented an adaptive signal quantization algorithm and a custom GRU-based\ndetector and developed a method for the detector parameters selection. Three\ndifferent datasets were used for testing the detector. Two artificially\ngenerated datasets were used to assess the raw performance of the system\nwhereas the 231 MB dataset composed of the signals acquired from HiLumi magnets\nwas intended for real-life experiments and model training. Several different\nsetups of the developed anomaly detection system were evaluated and compared\nwith state-of-the-art OC-SVM reference model operating on the same data. The\nOC-SVM model was equipped with a rich set of feature extractors accounting for\na range of the input signal properties. It was determined in the course of the\nexperiments that the detector, along with its supporting design methodology,\nreaches F1 equal or very close to 1 for almost all test sets. Due to the\nprofile of the data, the best_length setup of the detector turned out to\nperform the best among all five tested configuration schemes of the detection\nsystem. The quantization parameters have the biggest impact on the overall\nperformance of the detector with the best values of input/output grid equal to\n16 and 8, respectively. The proposed solution of the detection significantly\noutperformed OC-SVM-based detector in most of the cases, with much more stable\nperformance across all the datasets.",

This paper\ndemonstrates the power of differentiability for solving MOO problems using a\nDeep Differentiable Reinforcement Learning (DDRL) algorithm in particle\naccelerators. We compare DDRL algorithm with Model Free Reinforcement Learning\n(MFRL), GA and Bayesian Optimization (BO) for simultaneous optimization of heat\nload and trip rates in the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility\n(CEBAF). The underlying problem enforces strict constraints on both individual\nstates and actions as well as cumulative (global) constraint for energy\nrequirements of the beam. A physics-based surrogate model based on real data is\ndeveloped. This surrogate model is differentiable and allows back-propagation\nof gradients. The results are evaluated in the form of a Pareto-front for two\nobjectives. We show that the DDRL outperforms MFRL, BO, and GA on high\ndimensional problems.",

      "abstract": "The goal of this contribution is to introduce the Hamiltonian formalism of\ntheoretical mechanics for analysing motion in generic linear and non-linear\ndynamical systems, including particle accelerators. This framework allows the\nderivation and integration of equations of motion, in order to describe the\nparticle trajectory evolution with respect to time. First, basic concepts are\nre-visited for describing particle propagation through the resolution of\ndifferential equations, applied to linear and non-linear motion. These\nequations of motion can be obtained by the Lagrangian of the system, which is\nthe natural step leading to Hamiltonian Formalism and its properties. The\naccelerator ring Hamiltonian is derived, starting with the relativistic\nHamiltonian of particles in the influence of E/M fields and a series of\ncanonical (or symplectic) transformations and approximations. Thereby,\nintroductory concepts of beam dynamics such as invariants and transport\nmatrices are revisited and extended towards generic concepts such as\naction-angle variables and symplectic maps. To this end, the ground is prepared\nfor the advanced methods and tools used for studying non-linear motion in\nparticle accelerators.",

Methods: In this study, MR and CT imaging was\ncollected from 55 prostate cancer patients treated on an MR linear accelerator.\nML based plans were generated for each patient on both CT and MR imaging using\na commercially available model in RayStation 8B. The dose distributions and\nacceptance rates of MR and CT based plans were compared using institutional\ndose-volume evaluation criteria. The dosimetric differences between MR and CT\nplans were further decomposed into setup, cohort, and imaging domain\ncomponents. Results: MR plans were highly acceptable, meeting 93.1% of all\nevaluation criteria compared to 96.3% of CT plans, with dose equivalence for\nall evaluation criteria except for the bladder wall, penile bulb, small and\nlarge bowel, and one rectum wall criteria (p<0.05). Changing the input imaging\nmodality (domain component) only accounted for about half of the dosimetric\ndifferences observed between MR and CT plans. Anatomical differences between\nthe ML training set and the MR linac cohort (cohort component) were also a\nsignificant contributor.

Simulations using particles from the reference\nphase space on one hand and those generated by the GAN on the other hand were\ncompared. 3D distributions of deposited energy obtained from source\ndistributions generated by the GAN were close to the reference ones, with less\nthan 1% of voxel-by-voxel relative difference. Sharp parts such as the\nbrachytherapy emission lines in the energy spectra were not perfectly modeled\nby the GAN. Detailed statistical properties and limitations of the\nGAN-generated particles still require further investigation, but the proposed\nexploratory approach is already promising and paves the way for a wide range of\napplications.",

Due to the stochastic SASE operating principles and other\ntechnical issues the output pulses are subject to large fluctuations, making it\nnecessary to characterize the x-ray pulses on every shot for data sorting\npurposes. We present a technique that applies machine learning tools to predict\nx-ray pulse properties using simple electron beam and x-ray parameters as\ninput. Using this technique at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), we\nreport mean errors below 0.3 eV for the prediction of the photon energy at 530\neV and below 1.6 fs for the prediction of the delay between two x-ray pulses.\nWe also demonstrate spectral shape prediction with a mean agreement of 97%.\nThis approach could potentially be used at the next generation of\nhigh-repetition-rate XFELs to provide accurate knowledge of complex x-ray\npulses at the full repetition rate.",

      "abstract": "Synchrotron radiation sources play a crucial role in fields such as materials\nscience, biology, and chemistry. The beamline, a key subsystem of the\nsynchrotron, modulates and directs the radiation to the sample for analysis.\nHowever, the alignment of beamlines is a complex and time-consuming process,\nprimarily carried out manually by experienced engineers. Even minor\nmisalignments in optical components can significantly affect the beam's\nproperties, leading to suboptimal experimental outcomes. Current automated\nmethods, such as bayesian optimization (BO) and reinforcement learning (RL),\nalthough these methods enhance performance, limitations remain. The\nrelationship between the current and target beam properties, crucial for\ndetermining the adjustment, is not fully considered. Additionally, the physical\ncharacteristics of optical elements are overlooked, such as the need to adjust\nspecific devices to control the output beam's spot size or position. This paper\naddresses the alignment of beamlines by modeling it as a Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP) and training an intelligent agent using RL. The agent calculates\nadjustment values based on the current and target beam states, executes\nactions, and iterates until optimal parameters are achieved. A policy network\nwith action attention is designed to improve decision-making by considering\nboth state differences and the impact of optical components. Experiments on two\nsimulated beamlines demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing\nmethods, with ablation studies highlighting the effectiveness of the action\nattention-based policy network.",

An atomic\nstructure of a material can be identified by its diffraction pattern, along\nwith detailed analysis such as Rietveld refinement which indicates how the\nmeasured structure deviates from the ideal structure (e.g., internal stresses\nor defects). For in situ experiments, a series of XRD images is usually\ncollected on the same sample at different conditions (e.g., adiabatic\nconditions), yielding different states of matter, or simply collected\ncontinuously as a function of time to track the change of a sample over a\nchemical or physical process. In situ experiments are usually performed with\narea detectors, collecting 2D images composed of diffraction rings for ideal\npowders. Depending on the material's form, one may observe different\ncharacteristics other than the typical Debye Scherrer rings for a realistic\nsample and its environments, such as textures or preferred orientations and\nsingle crystal diffraction spots in the 2D XRD image. In this work, we present\nan investigation of machine learning methods for fast and reliable\nidentification and separation of the single crystal diffraction spots in XRD\nimages. The exclusion of artifacts during an XRD image integration process\nallows a precise analysis of the powder diffraction rings of interest. We\nobserve that the gradient boosting method can consistently produce high\naccuracy results when it is trained with small subsets of highly diverse\ndatasets.

      "abstract": "High-energy large-scale particle colliders generate data at extraordinary\nrates. Developing real-time high-throughput data compression algorithms to\nreduce data volume and meet the bandwidth requirement for storage has become\nincreasingly critical. Deep learning is a promising technology that can address\nthis challenging topic. At the newly constructed sPHENIX experiment at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider, a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) serves as the\nmain tracking detector, which records three-dimensional particle trajectories\nin a volume of a gas-filled cylinder. In terms of occupancy, the resulting data\nflow can be very sparse reaching $10^{-3}$ for proton-proton collisions. Such\nsparsity presents a challenge to conventional learning-free lossy compression\nalgorithms, such as SZ, ZFP, and MGARD. In contrast, emerging deep\nlearning-based models, particularly those utilizing convolutional neural\nnetworks for compression, have outperformed these conventional methods in terms\nof compression ratios and reconstruction accuracy. However, research on the\nefficacy of these deep learning models in handling sparse datasets, like those\nproduced in particle colliders, remains limited. Furthermore, most deep\nlearning models do not adapt their processing speeds to data sparsity, which\naffects efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for TPC\ndata compression via key-point identification facilitated by sparse\nconvolution. Our proposed algorithm, BCAE-VS, achieves a $75\\%$ improvement in\nreconstruction accuracy with a $10\\%$ increase in compression ratio over the\nprevious state-of-the-art model. Additionally, BCAE-VS manages to achieve these\nresults with a model size over two orders of magnitude smaller. Lastly, we have\nexperimentally verified that as sparsity increases, so does the model's\nthroughput.",

The plant utilizes 800 superconducting radio-frequency\ncavities in order to accelerate electron bunches to high energies of up to 17.5\nGeV. Various faulty events can disrupt the nominal functioning of the\naccelerator, including quenches that can lead to a loss of the\nsuperconductivity of the cavities and the interruption of their operation. In\nthis context, our solution consists in analyzing signals reflecting the\ndynamics of the cavities in a two-stage approach. (I) Fault detection that uses\nanalytical redundancy to process the data and generate a residual. The\nevaluation of the residual through the generalized likelihood ratio allows\ndetecting the faulty behaviors. (II) Fault isolation which involves the\ndistinction of the quenches from the other faults. To this end, we proceed with\na data-driven model of the k-medoids algorithm that explores different\nsimilarity measures, namely, the Euclidean and the dynamic time warping.\nFinally, we evaluate the new method and compare it to the currently deployed\nquench detection system, the results show the improved performance achieved by\nour method.",

However, these can be demanding in terms of\ncomputational resources and usually disregard transient and complex dynamics.\nModel-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative\nframework for optimising HPL performance since it allows to tune the control\nparameters as a function of system states subject to nonlinear temporal\ndynamics without requiring an explicit dynamics model of those. Furthermore,\nDRL aims to find an optimal control policy rather than a static parameter\nconfiguration, particularly suitable for dynamic processes involving sequential\ndecision-making. This is particularly relevant as laser systems are typically\ncharacterised by dynamic rather than static traits. Hence the need for a\nstrategy to choose the control applied based on the current context instead of\none single optimal control configuration. This paper investigates the potential\nof DRL in improving the efficiency and safety of HPL control systems. We apply\nthis technique to optimise the temporal profile of laser pulses in the L1 pump\nlaser hosted at the ELI Beamlines facility. We show how to adapt DRL to the\nsetting of spectral phase control by solely tuning dispersion coefficients of\nthe spectral phase and reaching pulses similar to transform limited with\nfull-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of ca1.6 ps.",

Such increased data processing requirements forces\nrevisions to almost every step of the data processing pipeline. One such step\nin need of an overhaul is the task of particle track reconstruction, a.k.a.,\ntracking. A Machine Learning-assisted solution is expected to provide\nsignificant improvements, since the most time-consuming step in tracking is the\nassignment of hits to particles or track candidates. This is the topic of this\npaper.\n  We take inspiration from large language models. As such, we consider two\napproaches: the prediction of the next word in a sentence (next hit point in a\ntrack), as well as the one-shot prediction of all hits within an event. In an\nextensive design effort, we have experimented with three models based on the\nTransformer architecture and one model based on the U-Net architecture,\nperforming track association predictions for collision event hit points. In our\nevaluation, we consider a spectrum of simple to complex representations of the\nproblem, eliminating designs with lower metrics early on. We report extensive\nresults, covering both prediction accuracy (score) and computational\nperformance. We have made use of the REDVID simulation framework, as well as\nreductions applied to the TrackML data set, to compose five data sets from\nsimple to complex, for our experiments. The results highlight distinct\nadvantages among different designs in terms of prediction accuracy and\ncomputational performance, demonstrating the efficiency of our methodology.\nMost importantly, the results show the viability of a one-shot\nencoder-classifier based Transformer solution as a practical approach for the\ntask of tracking.",

      "abstract": "The application of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) in track reconstruction is a\npromising approach to cope with the challenges arising at the High-Luminosity\nupgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). GNNs show good track-finding\nperformance in high-multiplicity scenarios and are naturally parallelizable on\nheterogeneous compute architectures.\n  Typical high-energy-physics detectors have high resolution in the innermost\nlayers to support vertex reconstruction but lower resolution in the outer\nparts. GNNs mainly rely on 3D space-point information, which can cause reduced\ntrack-finding performance in the outer regions.\n  In this contribution, we present a novel combination of GNN-based track\nfinding with the classical Combinatorial Kalman Filter (CKF) algorithm to\ncircumvent this issue: The GNN resolves the track candidates in the inner pixel\nregion, where 3D space points can represent measurements very well. These\ncandidates are then picked up by the CKF in the outer regions, where the CKF\nperforms well even for 1D measurements.\n  Using the ACTS infrastructure, we present a proof of concept based on truth\ntracking in the pixels as well as a dedicated GNN pipeline trained on\n$t\\bar{t}$ events with pile-up 200 in the OpenDataDetector.",

The radar pulse deinterleaving\nproblem is the task of separating out these pulses by the emitter from which\nthey originated.

To move a step closer towards practical application, the\nsensitivity analysis of two factors needs to be performed: biological washout\nand depth selection. selection. A bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN)\nmodel was developed. The training dataset was generated based upon a CT\nimage-based phantom (abdomen region) and multiple beam energies/pathways, using\nMonte-Carlo simulation (1 mm spatial resolution, no biological washout). For\nthe modeling of biological washout, a simplified analytical model was applied\nto change raw activity profiles over a period of 5 minutes, incorporating both\nphysical decay and biological washout. For the study of depth selection (a\nchallenge linked to multi field/angle irradiation), truncations were applied at\ndifferent window lengths (100, 125, 150 mm) to raw activity profiles. Finally,\nthe performance of a worst-case scenario was examined by combining both factors\n(depth selection: 125 mm, biological washout: 5 mins). The accuracy was\nquantitatively evaluated in terms of range uncertainty, mean absolute error\n(MAE) and mean relative errors (MRE). Our proposed AI framework shows good\nimmunity to the perturbation associated with two factors.

Such\npriors may be inadequate to capture the essence of complex wireless\nenvironments -- especially when severe shadowing happens. To circumvent such\nchallenges, offline-trained deep neural models of radio maps were considered\nfor SC, as deep neural networks (DNNs) are able to \"learn\" intricate underlying\nstructures from data. However, such deep learning (DL)-based SC approaches\nencounter serious challenges in both off-line model learning (training) and\ncompletion (generalization), possibly because the latent state space for\ngenerating the radio maps is prohibitively large. In this work, an emitter\nradio map disaggregation-based approach is proposed, under which only\nindividual emitters' radio maps are modeled by DNNs. This way, the learning and\ngeneralization challenges can both be substantially alleviated. Using the\nlearned DNNs, a fast nonnegative matrix factorization-based two-stage SC method\nand a performance-enhanced iterative optimization algorithm are proposed.\nTheoretical aspects -- such as recoverability of the radio tensor, sample\ncomplexity, and noise robustness -- under the proposed framework are\ncharacterized, and such theoretical properties have been elusive in the context\nof DL-based radio tensor completion. Experiments using synthetic and real-data\nfrom indoor and heavily shadowed environments are employed to showcase the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods.",

This\ntechnique has been used in numerous fields including materials science, shock\nphysics, inertial confinement fusion, and other national security applications.\nIn many of these applications, however, complications resulting from noise,\nscatter, complex beam dynamics, etc. prevent the reconstruction of density from\nbeing accurate enough to identify the underlying physics with sufficient\nconfidence. As such, density reconstruction from static/dynamic radiography has\ntypically been limited to identifying discontinuous features such as cracks and\nvoids in a number of these applications.\n  In this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach to reconstructing\ndensity from a temporal sequence of radiographic images. Using only the robust\nfeatures identifiable in radiographs, we combine them with the underlying\nhydrodynamic equations of motion using a machine learning approach, namely,\nconditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN), to determine the density\nfields from a dynamic sequence of radiographs. Next, we seek to further enhance\nthe hydrodynamic consistency of the ML-based density reconstruction through a\nprocess of parameter estimation and projection onto a hydrodynamic manifold. In\nthis context, we note that the distance from the hydrodynamic manifold given by\nthe training data to the test data in the parameter space considered both\nserves as a diagnostic of the robustness of the predictions and serves to\naugment the training database, with the expectation that the latter will\nfurther reduce future density reconstruction errors. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe ability of this method to outperform a traditional radiographic\nreconstruction in capturing allowable hydrodynamic paths even when relatively\nsmall amounts of scatter are present.",

      "abstract": "Predicting plasma evolution within a Tokamak reactor is crucial to realizing\nthe goal of sustainable fusion. Capabilities in forecasting the spatio-temporal\nevolution of plasma rapidly and accurately allow us to quickly iterate over\ndesign and control strategies on current Tokamak devices and future reactors.\nModelling plasma evolution using numerical solvers is often expensive,\nconsuming many hours on supercomputers, and hence, we need alternative\ninexpensive surrogate models. We demonstrate accurate predictions of plasma\nevolution both in simulation and experimental domains using deep learning-based\nsurrogate modelling tools, viz., Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). We show that\nFNO has a speedup of six orders of magnitude over traditional solvers in\npredicting the plasma dynamics simulated from magnetohydrodynamic models, while\nmaintaining a high accuracy (MSE in the normalised domain $\\approx$ $10^{-5}$).\nOur modified version of the FNO is capable of solving multi-variable Partial\nDifferential Equations (PDE), and can capture the dependence among the\ndifferent variables in a single model. FNOs can also predict plasma evolution\non real-world experimental data observed by the cameras positioned within the\nMAST Tokamak, i.e., cameras looking across the central solenoid and the\ndivertor in the Tokamak. We show that FNOs are able to accurately forecast the\nevolution of plasma and have the potential to be deployed for real-time\nmonitoring. We also illustrate their capability in forecasting the plasma\nshape, the locations of interactions of the plasma with the central solenoid\nand the divertor for the full (available) duration of the plasma shot within\nMAST. The FNO offers a viable alternative for surrogate modelling as it is\nquick to train and infer, and requires fewer data points, while being able to\ndo zero-shot super-resolution and getting high-fidelity solutions.",

The EIC Comprehensive Chromodynamics\nExperiment (ECCE) is a consortium that proposed a detector design based on a\n1.5T solenoid. The EIC detector proposal review concluded that the ECCE design\nwill serve as the reference design for an EIC detector. Herein we describe a\ncomprehensive optimization of the ECCE tracker using AI. The work required a\ncomplex parametrization of the simulated detector system. Our approach dealt\nwith an optimization problem in a multidimensional design space driven by\nmultiple objectives that encode the detector performance, while satisfying\nseveral mechanical constraints. We describe our strategy and show results\nobtained for the ECCE tracking system. The AI-assisted design is agnostic to\nthe simulation framework and can be extended to other sub-detectors or to a\nsystem of sub-detectors to further optimize the performance of the EIC\ndetector.",

      "abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT) is a critical cancer treatment, with volumetric modulated\narc therapy (VMAT) being a commonly used technique that enhances dose\nconformity by dynamically adjusting multileaf collimator (MLC) positions and\nmonitor units (MU) throughout gantry rotation. Adaptive radiotherapy requires\nfrequent modifications to treatment plans to account for anatomical variations,\nnecessitating time-efficient solutions. Deep learning offers a promising\nsolution to automate this process. To this end, we propose a two-stage,\nphysics-guided deep learning pipeline for radiotherapy planning. In the first\nstage, our network is trained with direct supervision on treatment plan\nparameters, consisting of MLC and MU values. In the second stage, we\nincorporate an additional supervision signal derived from the predicted 3D dose\ndistribution, integrating physics-based guidance into the training process. We\ntrain and evaluate our approach on 133 prostate cancer patients treated with a\nuniform 2-arc VMAT protocol delivering a dose of 62 Gy to the planning target\nvolume (PTV). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach, implemented\nusing both 3D U-Net and UNETR architectures, consistently produces treatment\nplans that closely match clinical ground truths. Our method achieves a mean\ndifference of D95% = 0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy and V95% = -0.22 +/- 1.87% at the PTV\nwhile generating dose distributions that reduce radiation exposure to organs at\nrisk. These findings highlight the potential of physics-guided deep learning in\nRT planning.",

The general background of\nthis study is the diagnosis and the predictive maintenance of AIRIX. We will\npresent a tool for fault diagnosis and monitoring based on pattern recognition\nusing artificial neural network. Parameters extracted from the signals recorded\non each shot are used to define a vector to be classified. The principal\ncomponent analysis permits us to select the most pertinent information and\nreduce the redundancy. A three layer Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network\nis used to classify the states of the accelerator. We initialize the network by\napplying an unsupervised fuzzy technique to the training base. This allows us\nto determine the number of clusters and real classes, which define the number\nof cells on the hidden and output layers of the network. The weights between\nthe hidden and the output layers, realising the non-convex union of the\nclusters, are determined by a least square method. Membership and ambiguity\nrejection enable the network to learn unknown failures, and to monitor\naccelerator operations to predict future failures. We will present the first\nresults obtained on the injector.",
