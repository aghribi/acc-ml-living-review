      "abstract": "Purpose Machine learning, as an advanced technology, has achieved remarkable success across various fields due to its powerful data processing and pattern recognition capabilities. When applied to particle accelerators, it has the potential to optimize performance, enhance operational efficiency, and drive innovation in accelerator technology. However, the adoption of machine learning often necessitates extensive knowledge of algorithms and programming, which can be time-consuming and create barriers to accessibility. Methods To overcome these challenges, the development of the machine learning as a service for accelerators (MLaaS4ACC) system is proposed. This system is designed to simplify the use of machine learning tools for accelerator researchers, efficiently perform machine learning tasks, and continuously expand and optimize functionalities tailored to the unique requirements of accelerator systems. Results and Conclusion Currently, MLaaS4ACC can effectively perform several straightforward machine learning tasks. Compared to traditional methods, it reduces the time required for actual tasks and simplifies the model training process, while yielding results that are not significantly different. The model already meets the necessary requirements. Looking ahead, it is essential to enhance and expand the system in various aspects to address more complex demands. Improvements in both the performance and functionality of MLaaS4ACC are necessary to ensure it meets these evolving requirements.",

Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across\ndifferent materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet\ncomputationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF\nengineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine\nlearning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar\ngeometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary\nelectron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -\nincluding Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting\n(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the\ntime-averaged electron growth rate, ${\\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated\nusing Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and\nPearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs\nin generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a\nscalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian\nhyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those\ntrained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis\nreveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint\nfeature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset\ncoverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based\nmultipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven\nmodeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.",

Multi-scale methods,\nbalancing between a coarse approximation of the fields at the scale of the\nmagnet and a detailed description at the scale of the conductors, are promising\napproaches to reduce the computational load while keeping a sufficient\naccuracy. In this work, we introduce a neural network approach to accelerate\nmulti-scale magneto-thermal simulations of LTS magnets by replacing costly\nsingle-turn FE models with neural network surrogates. The neural network\narchitecture is presented and discussed, together with an automated procedure\nfor generating simulation data for its training. The resulting accelerated\nmulti-scale model is used to simulate current ramp-up procedures for the IBA\nS2C2 magnet. The surrogate-based multi-scale model is compared with a\nconventional multi-scale model based on a composite wire-in-channel FE model.\nThe surrogate model is shown to reproduce single-turn filament hysteresis,\ninter-filament coupling, and eddy losses, while the computational time of the\nmulti-scale method is reduced by a factor of 800.",

In this work, a surrogate model based on a\nfully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict the\nspace-time current density distribution in REBCO solenoids. Training datasets\nwere generated from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes.\nThe results demonstrate that, for deeper networks, the FCRN architecture\nachieves better convergence than conventional fully connected network (FCN),\nwith the configuration of 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer\nproviding the most favorable balance between training accuracy and\ngeneralization capability. Extrapolation studies show that the model can\nreliably predict magnetization losses for up to 50% beyond the training range,\nwith maximum errors below 10%. The surrogate model achieves predictions several\norders of magnitude faster than FEM and still remains advantageous when\ntraining costs are included.

Proton computed tomography is a medical imaging technology with the potential to improve on current medical proton therapy treatment planning, but hampered by the computationally costly need to reconstruct individual proton tracks. With this in mind, we developed the Proton Path Neural Network, a neural network model capable of matching, and in some situations exceeding, the performance of the standard reconstruction method, with a significantly shorter execution time. Building on this experience, we turned to pattern recognition within track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment, one of the four major detector experiments located at CERN&amp;rsquo;s flagship LHC particle accelerator. Focusing on reconstruction within the VELO tracking subdetector, we developed a graph neural network approach with the capacity to draw inferences from all measurements made by the subdetector for a given event, which exhibited promising performance over existing trials.&lt;/p&gt;",

Given the tight spacing of 200 ns between these batches, the injection kickers have to be precisely synchronized with the injected beam to minimize injection oscillations.

This paper presents an active controller trained by reinforcement learning that counteracts the machine drifts by adjusting the settings. The agent was exclusively trained in a simulation environment and directly transferred to the accelerator. Although its results are slightly worse than those obtained by an explicit numerical optimizer, the BOBYQA algorithm, the agent attains these results much faster since it requires far less computation.",

      "abstract": "In high-energy and astroparticle physics, event generators play an essential role, even in the simplest data analyses. As analysis techniques become more sophisticated, e.g. based on deep neural networks, their correct description of the observed event characteristics becomes even more important. Physical processes occurring in hadronic collisions are simulated within a Monte Carlo framework. A major challenge is the modeling of hadron dynamics at low momentum transfer, which includes the initial and final phases of every hadronic collision. QCD-inspired phenomenological models used for these phases cannot guarantee completeness or correctness over the full phase space. These models usually include parameters which must be tuned to suitable experimental data. Until now, event generators have been developed and tuned mainly on the basis of data from high-energy physics experiments at accelerators. The wealth of data available from the latest generation of astroparticle experiments has not yet been fully exploited, and in many cases is not satisfactorily described. Both kinds of data sets are complementary as astroparticle experiments provide sensitivity especially to hadrons produced nearly parallel to the collision axis and cover center-of-mass energies up to several hundred TeV, well beyond those reached at colliders so far. In this report, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art event generators and their tuning, including the most relevant inputs from high-energy accelerator and astroparticle experiments. We present a road map that shows, for the first time, how the unified tuning of event generators with accelerator-based and astroparticle data can be performed.",

      "abstract": "X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando (tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane from a single hologram. Unlike most state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for phase retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach, as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and absorption information.",

Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models - including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the time-averaged electron growth rate, $δ_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.",

      "abstract": "A measurement of the thrust distribution in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 91.2$ GeV with archived data from the ALEPH experiment at the Large Electron-Positron Collider is presented. The thrust distribution is reconstructed from charged and neutral particles resulting from hadronic $Z$-boson decays. For the first time with $e^{+}e^{-}$ data, detector effects are corrected using a machine learning based method for unbinned unfolding. The measurement provides new input for resolving current discrepancies between theoretical calculations and experimental determinations of $α_{s}$, constraining non-perturbative effects through logarithmic moments, developing differential hadronization models, and enabling new precision studies using the archived data.",

A difficulty stems from a fact that a resolution function exhibits rather strong variations in shape, over approximately ten orders of magnitude in neutron energy. To avoid a need for a manual identification of the appropriate analytical forms—hindering past attempts at its parametrization—we take advantage of the versatile machine learning techniques. Specifically, we parametrized it by training a multilayer feedforward neural network, relying on a key idea that such network acts as a universal approximator. The proof-of-concept is presented for a resolution function for the first experimental area of the n_TOF facility from the third phase of its operation. We propose an optimal network structure for a resolution function in question, which is also expected to be optimal or near-optimal for other experimental areas and for different phases of n_TOF operation. To reconstruct several resolution function forms in common use from a single parametrized form, we provide a practical tool in the form of a specialized  class encapsulating the computationally efficient procedures suited to the task.</jats:p>",

Using \\texttt{Elegant} as the simulation backend,\nwe developed a Python wrapper that simplifies the interaction between RL\nalgorithms and accelerator simulations, enabling seamless input management,\nsimulation execution, and output analysis.\n  The proposed RL framework acts as a co-pilot for physicists, offering\nintelligent suggestions to enhance beamline performance, reduce tuning time,\nand improve operational efficiency. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the\napplication of our RL approach to an accelerator control problem and highlight\nthe improvements in efficiency and performance achieved through our\nmethodology.

      "abstract": "Adaptive physics-informed super-resolution diffusion is developed for\nnon-invasive virtual diagnostics of the 6D phase space density of charged\nparticle beams. An adaptive variational autoencoder (VAE) embeds initial beam\ncondition images and scalar measurements to a low-dimensional latent space from\nwhich a 326 pixel 6D tensor representation of the beam's 6D phase space density\nis generated. Projecting from a 6D tensor generates physically consistent 2D\nprojections. Physics-guided super-resolution diffusion transforms\nlow-resolution images of the 6D density to high resolution 256x256 pixel\nimages. Un-supervised adaptive latent space tuning enables tracking of\ntime-varying beams without knowledge of time-varying initial conditions. The\nmethod is demonstrated with experimental data and multi-particle simulations at\nthe HiRES UED. The general approach is applicable to a wide range of complex\ndynamic systems evolving in high-dimensional phase space. The method is shown\nto be robust to distribution shift without re-training.",

Their speed enables more efficient design studies by allowing\nextensive exploration of the input-output relationship without significant\ncomputational cost. We develop and compare the performance of three surrogate\nmodels, namely, multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision trees (DT) and Gaussian\nprocesses (GP). We show that using a simple and frugal MLP-based model trained\non a reasonable-size random scan data set of 500 particles in cell simulations,\nwe can predict beam parameters with a coefficient determination score\n$R^2=0.93$ . The best surrogate model is used to quickly find optimal working\npoints and stability regions and get targeted electron beam energy, charge,\nenergy spread and emittance using different methods, namely random search,\nBayesian optimisation and multi-objective Bayesian optimisation. This simple\napproach can serve more global design study of an LPI in a start-to-end linear\nlaser-driven accelerator.on beam energy, charge and energy spread using\ndifferent methods, namely random search, Bayesian optimisation and\nmulti-objective Bayesian optimisation",

Beam Steering is an essential\ntask for light sources. The Linac To Undulator is very difficult to steer and\naim due to the changes of each use of the accelerator there must be\nre-calibration of magnets. However with each use of the Beamline its current\nmethod of steering runs into issues when faced with calibrating angles and\npositions. Human operators spend a substantial amount of time and resources on\nthe task. We developed multiple different feed-forward-neural networks with\nvarying hyper-parameters, inputs, and outputs, seeking to compare their\nperformance. Specifically, our smaller models with 33 inputs and 13 outputs\noutperformed the larger models with 73 inputs and 50 outputs. We propose the\nfollowing explanations for this lack of performance in larger models. First, a\nlack of training time and computational power limited the ability of our models\nto mature. Given more time, our models would outperform SVD. Second, when the\ninput size of the model increases the noise increases as well. In this case\nmore inputs corresponded to a greater length upon the LINAC accelerator. Less\nspecific and larger models that seek to make more predictions will inherently\nperform worse than SVD.",

The DLMN facilitates the construction of a detailed accelerator\nmodel by integrating charged particle dynamics with machine learning\nmethodology in a data-driven framework. The primary observable is the centroid\nmotion over a limited number of turns, captured by beam position monitors. The\nDLMN produces an updated description of the accelerator in terms of magnetic\nmultipole components, which can be directly utilized in established accelerator\nphysics tools and tracking codes for further analysis. In this study, we apply\nthe DLMN to the SIS18 hadron synchrotron at GSI for the first time.\n  We discuss the validity of the recovered linear and non-linear optics,\nincluding quadrupole and sextupole errors, and compare our results with\nalternative methods, such as the LOCO fit of a measured orbit response matrix\nand the evaluation of resonance driving terms. The small number of required\ntrajectory measurements, one for linear and three for non-linear optics\nreconstruction, demonstrates the method's time efficiency. Our findings\nindicate that the DLMN is well-suited for identifying linear optics, and the\nrecovery of non-linear optics is achievable within the capabilities of the\ncurrent beam position monitor system. We demonstrate the application of DLMN\nresults through simulated resonance diagrams in tune space and their comparison\nwith measurements. The DLMN provides a novel tool for analyzing the causal\norigins of resonances and exploring potential compensation schemes.",

In many complex engineering systems, such as\nparticle accelerators, labels are sparse and expensive; in order to perform\nanomaly detection in these cases, we must drop these assumptions and utilize a\ncompletely unsupervised method. This paper introduces the Resilient Variational\nAutoencoder (ResVAE), a deep generative model specifically designed for anomaly\ndetection. ResVAE exhibits resilience to anomalies present in the training data\nand provides feature-level anomaly attribution. During the training process,\nResVAE learns the anomaly probability for each sample as well as each\nindividual feature, utilizing these probabilities to effectively disregard\nanomalous examples in the training data. We apply our proposed method to detect\nanomalies in the accelerator status at the SLAC Linac Coherent Light Source\n(LCLS). By utilizing shot-to-shot data from the beam position monitoring\nsystem, we demonstrate the exceptional capability of ResVAE in identifying\nvarious types of anomalies that are visible in the accelerator.",

In addition, the energy and phase space\ndistribution of particles emerging from the ion source are subject to\nfluctuations.

Combining deep neural networks with Gaussian process\napproximation techniques have shown promising results, but dimensionality\nreduction through standard deep neural network layers is not guaranteed to\nmaintain the distance information necessary for Gaussian process models. We\nbuild on previous work by comparing the use of the singular value decomposition\nagainst a spectral-normalized dense layer as a feature extractor for a deep\nneural Gaussian process approximation model and apply it to a capacitance\nprediction problem for the High Voltage Converter Modulators in the Oak Ridge\nSpallation Neutron Source. Our model shows improved distance preservation and\npredicts in-distribution capacitance values with less than 1% error.",

The model is formulated as logistic\nregression penalized by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, based\non a statistical two sample test to distinguish between unstable and stable\nstates of the accelerator.\n  The primary objective for receiving alarms prior to interlocks is to allow\nfor countermeasures and reduce beam time loss. Hence, a continuous evaluation\nmetric is developed to measure the saved beam time in any period, given the\nassumption that interlocks could be circumvented by reducing the beam current.\nThe best-performing interlock-to-stable classifier can potentially increase the\nbeam time by around 5 min in a day. Possible instrumentation for fast\nadjustment of the beam current is also listed and discussed.",

      "abstract": "Early fault detection and fault prognosis are crucial to ensure efficient and\nsafe operations of complex engineering systems such as the Spallation Neutron\nSource (SNS) and its power electronics (high voltage converter modulators).\nFollowing an advanced experimental facility setup that mimics SNS operating\nconditions, the authors successfully conducted 21 fault prognosis experiments,\nwhere fault precursors are introduced in the system to a degree enough to cause\ndegradation in the waveform signals, but not enough to reach a real fault. Nine\ndifferent machine learning techniques based on ensemble trees, convolutional\nneural networks, support vector machines, and hierarchical voting ensembles are\nproposed to detect the fault precursors. Although all 9 models have shown a\nperfect and identical performance during the training and testing phase, the\nperformance of most models has decreased in the prognosis phase once they got\nexposed to real-world data from the 21 experiments. The hierarchical voting\nensemble, which features multiple layers of diverse models, maintains a\ndistinguished performance in early detection of the fault precursors with 95%\nsuccess rate (20/21 tests), followed by adaboost and extremely randomized trees\nwith 52% and 48% success rates, respectively. The support vector machine models\nwere the worst with only 24% success rate (5/21 tests). The study concluded\nthat a successful implementation of machine learning in the SNS or particle\naccelerator power systems would require a major upgrade in the controller and\nthe data acquisition system to facilitate streaming and handling big data for\nthe machine learning models. In addition, this study shows that the best\nperforming models were diverse and based on the ensemble concept to reduce the\nbias and hyperparameter sensitivity of individual models.",

Extraction of this information is\nan intricate process, however. To demonstrate how to approach this challenge\nwith modern methods, this paper utilizes data from simulated plasma wakefield\nacceleration-derived betatron radiation experiments and high-field\nlaser-electron-based radiation production to determine reliable methods of\nreconstructing key beam and interaction properties. For these measurements,\nrecovering the emitted 200 keV to 10 GeV photon energy spectra from two\nadvanced spectrometers now being commissioned requires testing multiple methods\nto finalize a pipeline from their responses to incident electron beam\ninformation. In each case, we compare the performance of: neural networks,\nwhich detect patterns between data sets through repeated training; maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE), a statistical technique used to determine unknown\nparameters from the distribution of observed data; and a hybrid approach\ncombining the two. Further, in the case of photons with energies above 30 MeV,\nwe also examine the efficacy of QR decomposition, a matrix decomposition\nmethod. The betatron radiation and the high-energy photon cases demonstrate the\neffectiveness of a hybrid ML-MLE approach, while the high-field electrodynamics\ninteraction and the low-energy photon cases showcased the machine learning (ML)\nmodel's efficiency in the presence of noise. As such, while there is utility in\nall the methods, the ML-MLE hybrid approach proves to be the most\ngeneralizable.",

One of the most computationally\nexpensive and difficult-to-model effects is the impact of Coherent Synchrotron\nRadiation (CSR). As a beam travels through a curved trajectory (e.g. due to a\nbending magnet), it emits radiation that in turn interacts with the rest of the\nbeam. At each step through the trajectory, the electromagnetic field introduced\nby CSR (called the CSR wakefield) needs to computed and used when calculating\nthe updates to the positions and momenta of every particle in the beam. CSR is\none of the major drivers of growth in the beam emittance, which is a key metric\nof beam quality that is critical in many applications. The CSR wakefield is\nvery computationally intensive to compute with traditional electromagnetic\nsolvers, and this is a major limitation in accurately simulating accelerators.\nHere, we demonstrate a new approach for the CSR wakefield computation using a\nneural network solver structured in a way that is readily generalizable to new\nsetups. We validate its performance by adding it to a standard beam tracking\ntest problem and show a ten-fold speedup along with high accuracy.",

      "abstract": "As charged particle bunches become shorter and more intense, the effects of\nnonlinear intra-bunch collective interactions such as space charge forces and\nbunch-to-bunch influences such as wakefields and coherent synchrotron radiation\nalso increase. Shorter more intense bunches are also more difficult to\naccurately image because their dimensions are beyond the resolution of existing\ndiagnostics and they may be destructive to intercepting diagnostics. The\nlimited availability of detailed diagnostics for intense high energy beams is a\nfundamental challenge for the accelerator community because both beams and\naccelerators are time-varying systems that change in unpredictable ways. The\ndetailed 6D (x,y,z,px,py,pz) distributions of beams emerging from sources vary\nwith time due to factors such as evolving photocathode laser intensity profiles\nand the quantum efficiency of photocathodes. Accelerator magnets, RF\namplifiers, and control systems are perturbed by external disturbances,\nbeam-loading effects, temperature variations, and misalignments. Although\nmachine learning (ML) methods have grown in popularity in the accelerator\ncommunity in recently years, they are fundamentally limited when it comes to\ntime-varying systems for which most current approaches are to simply collect\nlarge new data sets and perform re-training, something which is not feasible\nfor busy accelerator user facilities because detailed beam measurements usually\ninterrupt operations. New adaptive machine learning (AML) methods designed for\ntime-varying systems are needed to aid in the diagnostics and control of\nhigh-intensity, ultrashort beams by combining deep learning tools such as\nconvolutional neural network-based encoder-decoder architectures,\nmodel-independent feedback, physics constraints, and online models with real\ntime non-invasive beam data, to provide a detailed virtual view of intense\nbunch dynamics.",

Efficient control of\nthe RFQ resonance frequency detuning still remains a challenge because the\ntemperature-sensitive frequency is solely control by a cooling water system,\nexhibiting complicated transport delay and nonlinearity in the heat transfer\nprocesses. In this work, we propose a long-short term memory (LSTM)-based\nKoopman network model that can simultaneously learn the time-delayed and\nnon-delayed correlations hidden in the historical operating data. It is proven\nthat the model can effectively predict the behavior of the RFQ resonance\nfrequency using historical data as inputs. With this model, a model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) framework based on the Newton-Raphson method is proposed and\ntested. We demonstrate that the MPC framework utilizing deep learning model is\nable to provide precise and rapid control for the RFQ frequency detuning,\nreducing the control time by half compared to the\nproportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.",

      "abstract": "Anomalies in radio-frequency (RF) stations can result in unplanned downtime\nand performance degradation in linear accelerators such as SLAC's Linac\nCoherent Light Source (LCLS). Detecting these anomalies is challenging due to\nthe complexity of accelerator systems, high data volume, and scarcity of\nlabeled fault data. Prior work identified faults using beam-based detection,\ncombining RF amplitude and beam-position monitor data. Due to the simplicity of\nthe RF amplitude data, classical methods are sufficient to identify faults, but\nthe recall is constrained by the low-frequency and asynchronous characteristics\nof the data. In this work, we leverage high-frequency, time-synchronous RF\nphase data to enhance anomaly detection in the LCLS accelerator. Due to the\ncomplexity of phase data, classical methods fail, and we instead train deep\nneural networks within the Coincident Anomaly Detection (CoAD) framework. We\nfind that applying CoAD to phase data detects nearly three times as many\nanomalies as when applied to amplitude data, while achieving broader coverage\nacross RF stations. Furthermore, the rich structure of phase data enables us to\ncluster anomalies into distinct physical categories. Through the integration of\nauxiliary system status bits, we link clusters to specific fault signatures,\nproviding additional granularity for uncovering the root cause of faults. We\nalso investigate interpretability via Shapley values, confirming that the\nlearned models focus on the most informative regions of the data and providing\ninsight for cases where the model makes mistakes. This work demonstrates that\nphase-based anomaly detection for RF stations improves both diagnostic coverage\nand root cause analysis in accelerator systems and that deep neural networks\nare essential for effective analysis.",

It describes the extent of the phase-space\nregion where a particle's motion remains bounded over a given number of turns.\nUnderstanding the features of dynamic aperture is crucial for the design and\noperation of such accelerators, as it provides insights into nonlinear effects\nand the possibility of optimising beam lifetime. The standard approach to\ncalculate the dynamic aperture requires numerical simulations of several\ninitial conditions densely distributed in phase space for a sufficient number\nof turns to probe the time scale corresponding to machine operations. This\nprocess is very computationally intensive and practically outside the range of\ntoday's computers. In our study, we introduced a novel method to estimate\ndynamic aperture rapidly and accurately by utilising a Deep Neural Network\nmodel. This model was trained with simulated tracking data from the CERN Large\nHadron Collider and takes into account variations in accelerator parameters\nsuch as betatron tune, chromaticity, and the strength of the Landau octupoles.\nTo enhance its performance, we integrate the model into an innovative Active\nLearning framework. This framework not only enables retraining and updating of\nthe computed model, but also facilitates efficient data generation through\nsmart sampling. Since chaotic motion cannot be predicted, traditional tracking\nsimulations are incorporated into the Active Learning framework to deal with\nthe chaotic nature of some initial conditions. The results demonstrate that the\nuse of the Active Learning framework allows faster scanning of the\nconfiguration parameters without compromising the accuracy of the dynamic\naperture estimates.",

Despite their\nstrengths, applying ML to time-varying systems, or systems with shifting\ndistributions, is an open problem, especially for large systems for which\ncollecting new data for re-training is impractical or interrupts operations.\nParticle accelerators are one example of large time-varying systems for which\ncollecting detailed training data requires lengthy dedicated beam measurements\nwhich may no longer be available during regular operations. We present a\nrecently developed method of adaptive ML for time-varying systems. Our approach\nis to map very high (N>100k) dimensional inputs (a combination of scalar\nparameters and images) into the low dimensional (N~2) latent space at the\noutput of the encoder section of an encoder-decoder CNN. We then actively tune\nthe low dimensional latent space-based representation of complex system\ndynamics by the addition of an adaptively tuned feedback vector directly before\nthe decoder sections builds back up to our image-based high-dimensional phase\nspace density representations.

In addition,\nthese inputs often vary over time, and models that can account for these\nchanging conditions are needed. Simulations are in some cases needed to provide\nsufficient training data. These typically represent the designed machine before\nconstruction; however, the behavior of the installed components may be quite\ndifferent due to changes over time or static differences that were not modeled.\nTherefore, surrogate models that can leverage both simulation and measured data\nsuccessfully are needed. We introduce an approach based on convolutional neural\nnetworks that uses the drive laser distribution and scalar settings as inputs\nfor the Linac Coherent Light Source II injector frontend. The model is able to\npredict scalar beam parameters and the transverse beam distribution downstream,\ntaking into account the impact of time-varying non-uniformities in the initial\ntransverse laser distribution. We also introduce and evaluate a transfer\nlearning procedure for adapting the surrogate model from the simulation domain\nto the measurement domain, to account for differences between the two. Applying\nthis approach to our test case results in a model that can predict test sample\noutputs within a mean absolute percent error of 7.6%. This is a substantial\nimprovement over the model trained only on simulations, which has an error of\n112.7% when applied to measured data. While we focus on the LCLS-II Injector\nfrontend, these approaches for improving ML-based online modeling of injector\nsystems could be easily adapted to other accelerator facilities.",

In our approach, the Taylor maps arising\nin the representation of dynamics are mapped onto the weights of a polynomial\nneural network. The resulting network approximates the dynamical system with\nperfect accuracy prior to training and provides a possibility to tune the\nnetwork weights on additional experimental data. We propose a symplectic\nregularization approach for such polynomial neural networks that always\nrestricts the trained model to Hamiltonian systems and significantly improves\nthe training procedure. The proposed networks can be used for beam dynamics\nsimulations or for fine-tuning of beam optics models with experimental data.\nThe structure of the network allows for the modeling of large accelerators with\na large number of magnets. We demonstrate our approach on the examples of the\nexisting PETRA III and the planned PETRA IV storage rings at DESY.",

In order to conduct the experiments, the authors designed and\nimplemented an adaptive signal quantization algorithm and a custom GRU-based\ndetector and developed a method for the detector parameters selection. Three\ndifferent datasets were used for testing the detector. Two artificially\ngenerated datasets were used to assess the raw performance of the system\nwhereas the 231 MB dataset composed of the signals acquired from HiLumi magnets\nwas intended for real-life experiments and model training. Several different\nsetups of the developed anomaly detection system were evaluated and compared\nwith state-of-the-art OC-SVM reference model operating on the same data. The\nOC-SVM model was equipped with a rich set of feature extractors accounting for\na range of the input signal properties. It was determined in the course of the\nexperiments that the detector, along with its supporting design methodology,\nreaches F1 equal or very close to 1 for almost all test sets. Due to the\nprofile of the data, the best_length setup of the detector turned out to\nperform the best among all five tested configuration schemes of the detection\nsystem. The quantization parameters have the biggest impact on the overall\nperformance of the detector with the best values of input/output grid equal to\n16 and 8, respectively. The proposed solution of the detection significantly\noutperformed OC-SVM-based detector in most of the cases, with much more stable\nperformance across all the datasets.",

      "abstract": "Particle accelerator operation requires simultaneous optimization of multiple\nobjectives. Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is particularly challenging due\nto trade-offs between the objectives. Evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic\nalgorithm (GA), have been leveraged for many optimization problems, however,\nthey do not apply to complex control problems by design. This paper\ndemonstrates the power of differentiability for solving MOO problems using a\nDeep Differentiable Reinforcement Learning (DDRL) algorithm in particle\naccelerators. We compare DDRL algorithm with Model Free Reinforcement Learning\n(MFRL), GA and Bayesian Optimization (BO) for simultaneous optimization of heat\nload and trip rates in the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility\n(CEBAF). The underlying problem enforces strict constraints on both individual\nstates and actions as well as cumulative (global) constraint for energy\nrequirements of the beam. A physics-based surrogate model based on real data is\ndeveloped. This surrogate model is differentiable and allows back-propagation\nof gradients. The results are evaluated in the form of a Pareto-front for two\nobjectives. We show that the DDRL outperforms MFRL, BO, and GA on high\ndimensional problems.",

Electromagnetic fields around a charged beam carry information\nabout its transverse profile.

We use a genetic algorithm to transform an\narbitrary Gaussian beam in such a way that it eventually reconstructs the\ntransverse position and the shape of the original beam. The algorithm requires\na signal that is picked up by the stripline electrodes, and a (precise or\napproximate) knowledge of the beam size.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose an AI-enabled framework that leverages\npredictive analytics and automated labeling. Using data from $2,703$ Linac\ndevices and $80$ operator-labeled outages, we evaluate state-of-the-art deep\nlearning architectures, including recurrent, attention-based, and linear\nmodels, for beam outage prediction. Additionally, we assess a Random\nForest-based labeling system for providing consistent, confidence-scored outage\nannotations. Our findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these\narchitectures for beam outage prediction and identify critical gaps that must\nbe addressed to fully harness AI for transitioning downtime handling from\nreactive to predictive, ultimately reducing downtime and improving\ndecision-making in accelerator management.",

Given the rising importance of Magnetic resonance (MR) only treatment\nplanning workflows, we sought to determine if an ML based treatment planning\nmodel, trained on computed tomography (CT) imaging, could be applied to MR\nthrough domain adaptation. Methods: In this study, MR and CT imaging was\ncollected from 55 prostate cancer patients treated on an MR linear accelerator.\nML based plans were generated for each patient on both CT and MR imaging using\na commercially available model in RayStation 8B. The dose distributions and\nacceptance rates of MR and CT based plans were compared using institutional\ndose-volume evaluation criteria. The dosimetric differences between MR and CT\nplans were further decomposed into setup, cohort, and imaging domain\ncomponents. Results: MR plans were highly acceptable, meeting 93.1% of all\nevaluation criteria compared to 96.3% of CT plans, with dose equivalence for\nall evaluation criteria except for the bladder wall, penile bulb, small and\nlarge bowel, and one rectum wall criteria (p<0.05). Changing the input imaging\nmodality (domain component) only accounted for about half of the dosimetric\ndifferences observed between MR and CT plans. Anatomical differences between\nthe ML training set and the MR linac cohort (cohort component) were also a\nsignificant contributor. Significance: We were able to create highly acceptable\nMR based treatment plans using a CT-trained ML model for treatment planning,\nalthough clinically significant dose deviations from the CT based plans were\nobserved.",

Of these, 96 cavities (12 cryomodules) are designed with\na digital low-level RF system configured such that a cavity fault triggers\nwaveform recordings of 17 RF signals for each of the 8 cavities in the\ncryomodule. Subject matter experts (SME) are able to analyze the collected\ntime-series data and identify which of the eight cavities faulted first and\nclassify the type of fault. This information is used to find trends and\nstrategically deploy mitigations to problematic cryomodules. However manually\nlabeling the data is laborious and time-consuming.

At the end of the training process, G is\nstored with about 0.5 million weights, around 10 MB, instead of few GB of the\ninitial file. Particles are then generated with G to replace the phase space\ndataset.\n  This concept is applied to beam models from linear accelerators (linacs) and\nfrom brachytherapy seed models. Simulations using particles from the reference\nphase space on one hand and those generated by the GAN on the other hand were\ncompared. 3D distributions of deposited energy obtained from source\ndistributions generated by the GAN were close to the reference ones, with less\nthan 1% of voxel-by-voxel relative difference. Sharp parts such as the\nbrachytherapy emission lines in the energy spectra were not perfectly modeled\nby the GAN.

      "abstract": "Synchrotron radiation sources play a crucial role in fields such as materials\nscience, biology, and chemistry. The beamline, a key subsystem of the\nsynchrotron, modulates and directs the radiation to the sample for analysis.\nHowever, the alignment of beamlines is a complex and time-consuming process,\nprimarily carried out manually by experienced engineers. Even minor\nmisalignments in optical components can significantly affect the beam's\nproperties, leading to suboptimal experimental outcomes. Current automated\nmethods, such as bayesian optimization (BO) and reinforcement learning (RL),\nalthough these methods enhance performance, limitations remain. The\nrelationship between the current and target beam properties, crucial for\ndetermining the adjustment, is not fully considered. Additionally, the physical\ncharacteristics of optical elements are overlooked, such as the need to adjust\nspecific devices to control the output beam's spot size or position. This paper\naddresses the alignment of beamlines by modeling it as a Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP) and training an intelligent agent using RL. The agent calculates\nadjustment values based on the current and target beam states, executes\nactions, and iterates until optimal parameters are achieved. A policy network\nwith action attention is designed to improve decision-making by considering\nboth state differences and the impact of optical components. Experiments on two\nsimulated beamlines demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing\nmethods, with ablation studies highlighting the effectiveness of the action\nattention-based policy network.",

An atomic\nstructure of a material can be identified by its diffraction pattern, along\nwith detailed analysis such as Rietveld refinement which indicates how the\nmeasured structure deviates from the ideal structure (e.g., internal stresses\nor defects). For in situ experiments, a series of XRD images is usually\ncollected on the same sample at different conditions (e.g., adiabatic\nconditions), yielding different states of matter, or simply collected\ncontinuously as a function of time to track the change of a sample over a\nchemical or physical process. In situ experiments are usually performed with\narea detectors, collecting 2D images composed of diffraction rings for ideal\npowders. Depending on the material's form, one may observe different\ncharacteristics other than the typical Debye Scherrer rings for a realistic\nsample and its environments, such as textures or preferred orientations and\nsingle crystal diffraction spots in the 2D XRD image. In this work, we present\nan investigation of machine learning methods for fast and reliable\nidentification and separation of the single crystal diffraction spots in XRD\nimages. The exclusion of artifacts during an XRD image integration process\nallows a precise analysis of the powder diffraction rings of interest. We\nobserve that the gradient boosting method can consistently produce high\naccuracy results when it is trained with small subsets of highly diverse\ndatasets.

      "abstract": "High-energy large-scale particle colliders generate data at extraordinary\nrates. Developing real-time high-throughput data compression algorithms to\nreduce data volume and meet the bandwidth requirement for storage has become\nincreasingly critical. Deep learning is a promising technology that can address\nthis challenging topic. At the newly constructed sPHENIX experiment at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider, a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) serves as the\nmain tracking detector, which records three-dimensional particle trajectories\nin a volume of a gas-filled cylinder. In terms of occupancy, the resulting data\nflow can be very sparse reaching $10^{-3}$ for proton-proton collisions. Such\nsparsity presents a challenge to conventional learning-free lossy compression\nalgorithms, such as SZ, ZFP, and MGARD. In contrast, emerging deep\nlearning-based models, particularly those utilizing convolutional neural\nnetworks for compression, have outperformed these conventional methods in terms\nof compression ratios and reconstruction accuracy. However, research on the\nefficacy of these deep learning models in handling sparse datasets, like those\nproduced in particle colliders, remains limited. Furthermore, most deep\nlearning models do not adapt their processing speeds to data sparsity, which\naffects efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for TPC\ndata compression via key-point identification facilitated by sparse\nconvolution. Our proposed algorithm, BCAE-VS, achieves a $75\\%$ improvement in\nreconstruction accuracy with a $10\\%$ increase in compression ratio over the\nprevious state-of-the-art model. Additionally, BCAE-VS manages to achieve these\nresults with a model size over two orders of magnitude smaller. Lastly, we have\nexperimentally verified that as sparsity increases, so does the model's\nthroughput.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we present a method to create a robust inverse surrogate model\nfor a soft X-ray spectrometer. During a beamtime at an electron storage ring,\nsuch as BESSY II, instrumentation and beamlines are required to be correctly\naligned and calibrated for optimal experimental conditions. In order to\nautomate these processes, machine learning methods can be developed and\nimplemented, but in many cases these methods require the use of an inverse\nmodel which maps the output of the experiment, such as a detector image, to the\nparameters of the device. Due to limited experimental data, such models are\noften trained with simulated data, which creates the challenge of compensating\nfor the inherent differences between simulation and experiment. In order to\nclose this gap, we demonstrate the application of data augmentation and\nadversarial domain adaptation techniques, with which we can predict absolute\ncoordinates for the automated alignment of our spectrometer. Bridging the\nsimulation-experiment gap with minimal real-world data opens new avenues for\nautomated experimentation using machine learning in scientific instrumentation.",

However, these can be demanding in terms of\ncomputational resources and usually disregard transient and complex dynamics.\nModel-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative\nframework for optimising HPL performance since it allows to tune the control\nparameters as a function of system states subject to nonlinear temporal\ndynamics without requiring an explicit dynamics model of those. Furthermore,\nDRL aims to find an optimal control policy rather than a static parameter\nconfiguration, particularly suitable for dynamic processes involving sequential\ndecision-making. This is particularly relevant as laser systems are typically\ncharacterised by dynamic rather than static traits. Hence the need for a\nstrategy to choose the control applied based on the current context instead of\none single optimal control configuration. This paper investigates the potential\nof DRL in improving the efficiency and safety of HPL control systems. We apply\nthis technique to optimise the temporal profile of laser pulses in the L1 pump\nlaser hosted at the ELI Beamlines facility. We show how to adapt DRL to the\nsetting of spectral phase control by solely tuning dispersion coefficients of\nthe spectral phase and reaching pulses similar to transform limited with\nfull-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of ca1.6 ps.",

For instance, experiments at LCLS-II-HE will require the X-ray beam to\nbe within a fraction of a micron in diameter, with pointing stability of a few\nnanoradians, at the end of a kilometer-long electron accelerator, a\nhundred-meter-long undulator section, and tens of meters long X-ray optics.\nThis enhancement of brightness will increase the data production rate to rival\nthe largest data generators in the world. Without real-time active feedback\ncontrol and an optimized pipeline to transform measurements to scientific\ninformation and insights, researchers will drown in a deluge of mostly useless\ndata, and fail to extract the highly sophisticated insights that the recent\nbrightness upgrades promise.\n  In this article, we outline the strategy we are developing at SLAC to\nimplement Machine Learning driven optimization, automation and real-time\nknowledge extraction from the electron-injector at the start of the electron\naccelerator, to the multidimensional X-ray optical systems, and till the\nexperimental endstations and the high readout rate, multi-megapixel detectors\nat LCLS to deliver the design performance to the users.

Such\npriors may be inadequate to capture the essence of complex wireless\nenvironments -- especially when severe shadowing happens. To circumvent such\nchallenges, offline-trained deep neural models of radio maps were considered\nfor SC, as deep neural networks (DNNs) are able to \"learn\" intricate underlying\nstructures from data. However, such deep learning (DL)-based SC approaches\nencounter serious challenges in both off-line model learning (training) and\ncompletion (generalization), possibly because the latent state space for\ngenerating the radio maps is prohibitively large. In this work, an emitter\nradio map disaggregation-based approach is proposed, under which only\nindividual emitters' radio maps are modeled by DNNs. This way, the learning and\ngeneralization challenges can both be substantially alleviated. Using the\nlearned DNNs, a fast nonnegative matrix factorization-based two-stage SC method\nand a performance-enhanced iterative optimization algorithm are proposed.\nTheoretical aspects -- such as recoverability of the radio tensor, sample\ncomplexity, and noise robustness -- under the proposed framework are\ncharacterized, and such theoretical properties have been elusive in the context\nof DL-based radio tensor completion. Experiments using synthetic and real-data\nfrom indoor and heavily shadowed environments are employed to showcase the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods.",

Moreover, we establish a\nuniversal power-law relationship between the first three cumulants of the kink\nnumbers and the quench rate, indicating a binomial distribution of the kinks.\nFinally, the normalized kink-kink correlations are also investigated and it is\nfound that the numerical values are consistent with the analytic formula.",

      "abstract": "Radiography is often used to probe complex, evolving density fields in\ndynamic systems and in so doing gain insight into the underlying physics. This\ntechnique has been used in numerous fields including materials science, shock\nphysics, inertial confinement fusion, and other national security applications.\nIn many of these applications, however, complications resulting from noise,\nscatter, complex beam dynamics, etc. prevent the reconstruction of density from\nbeing accurate enough to identify the underlying physics with sufficient\nconfidence. As such, density reconstruction from static/dynamic radiography has\ntypically been limited to identifying discontinuous features such as cracks and\nvoids in a number of these applications.\n  In this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach to reconstructing\ndensity from a temporal sequence of radiographic images. Using only the robust\nfeatures identifiable in radiographs, we combine them with the underlying\nhydrodynamic equations of motion using a machine learning approach, namely,\nconditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN), to determine the density\nfields from a dynamic sequence of radiographs. Next, we seek to further enhance\nthe hydrodynamic consistency of the ML-based density reconstruction through a\nprocess of parameter estimation and projection onto a hydrodynamic manifold. In\nthis context, we note that the distance from the hydrodynamic manifold given by\nthe training data to the test data in the parameter space considered both\nserves as a diagnostic of the robustness of the predictions and serves to\naugment the training database, with the expectation that the latter will\nfurther reduce future density reconstruction errors. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe ability of this method to outperform a traditional radiographic\nreconstruction in capturing allowable hydrodynamic paths even when relatively\nsmall amounts of scatter are present.",

Capabilities in forecasting the spatio-temporal\nevolution of plasma rapidly and accurately allow us to quickly iterate over\ndesign and control strategies on current Tokamak devices and future reactors.\nModelling plasma evolution using numerical solvers is often expensive,\nconsuming many hours on supercomputers, and hence, we need alternative\ninexpensive surrogate models. We demonstrate accurate predictions of plasma\nevolution both in simulation and experimental domains using deep learning-based\nsurrogate modelling tools, viz., Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). We show that\nFNO has a speedup of six orders of magnitude over traditional solvers in\npredicting the plasma dynamics simulated from magnetohydrodynamic models, while\nmaintaining a high accuracy (MSE in the normalised domain $\\approx$ $10^{-5}$).\nOur modified version of the FNO is capable of solving multi-variable Partial\nDifferential Equations (PDE), and can capture the dependence among the\ndifferent variables in a single model. FNOs can also predict plasma evolution\non real-world experimental data observed by the cameras positioned within the\nMAST Tokamak, i.e., cameras looking across the central solenoid and the\ndivertor in the Tokamak. We show that FNOs are able to accurately forecast the\nevolution of plasma and have the potential to be deployed for real-time\nmonitoring. We also illustrate their capability in forecasting the plasma\nshape, the locations of interactions of the plasma with the central solenoid\nand the divertor for the full (available) duration of the plasma shot within\nMAST. The FNO offers a viable alternative for surrogate modelling as it is\nquick to train and infer, and requires fewer data points, while being able to\ndo zero-shot super-resolution and getting high-fidelity solutions.",

The work required a\ncomplex parametrization of the simulated detector system. Our approach dealt\nwith an optimization problem in a multidimensional design space driven by\nmultiple objectives that encode the detector performance, while satisfying\nseveral mechanical constraints. We describe our strategy and show results\nobtained for the ECCE tracking system. The AI-assisted design is agnostic to\nthe simulation framework and can be extended to other sub-detectors or to a\nsystem of sub-detectors to further optimize the performance of the EIC\ndetector.",

A vital aspect of reconstruction algorithms is particle identification, which combines information from various detector components to determine the type of particle. Electron identification is particularly significant in electro-production nuclear physics experiments like the CLAS12 spectrometer at Jefferson Laboratory as it is essential in data recording. A machine learning approach has been developed for CLAS12 experiments to reconstruct and identify electrons by combining raw signals from multiple detector components at the data acquisition level. This method achieves high electron identification purity while maintaining nearly 100% efficiency. Furthermore, the machine learning tools operate at rates exceeding data acquisition speed, enabling the real-time electron reconstruction. This advancement significantly improves online analyses and monitoring capabilities for CLAS12 experiments.",

      "abstract": "Symplectic simulation of space-charge effects is crucial for the design and operation of high-intensity particle accelerators. Traditional methods for simulating these effects are often computationally expensive, resulting in significant overhead. In this work, we introduce a generative model based on a U-Net architecture within a generative adversarial network framework to efficiently simulate space-charge effects. The model is trained to predict the transverse multiparticle space-charge Hamiltonian, which can be physically computed using a gridless spectral method. The one-step symplectic transverse transfer map for the particles is then obtained by differentiating the predicted Hamiltonian. Benchmarking results demonstrate that this generative model achieves an order of magnitude higher computational efficiency compared to the spectral method, providing a highly efficient alternative for simulating space-charge effects with a large number of particles. By maintaining symplecticity, the model effectively preserves the phase-space structure and mitigates nonphysical errors in long-term simulations. This model has been integrated into jutrack, a novel autodifferentiable accelerator modeling code developed in the julia programming language.",

In this paper, we have applied a quantum machine learning algorithm, the variational quantum classifier for the first time in accelerator physics. Specifically, we utilized the variational quantum classifier to evaluate the dynamic aperture of a diffraction-limited storage ring. It has been demonstrated that the variational quantum classifier can achieve good accuracy much faster than the classical artificial neural network, with the statistics of training samples increasing. And the accuracy of the variational quantum classifier is always higher than that of an artificial neural network, although they are very close when the statistics of training samples reach high. Furthermore, we have investigated the impact of noise on the variational quantum classifier, and found that the variational quantum classifier maintains robust performance even in the presence of noise.",

The proposed methodology allows to model a highly complex non-linear nature of the experiments. Even though laser wakefield electron acceleration has a developed approximation theory, it falls short in the edge cases. Additionally, as the methodology leverages physical laws known a priori, the model is able to capture manifold constraints outside of the training data, which is generally uncommon for machine learning models. Applying a physics-informed denoising diffusion implicit model to simulate the output of the accelerator demonstrates superior performance over the traditional architecture in terms of Fréchet inception distance, and produces results that are positively evaluated by experts in the field. This approach shows a valuable contribution of generative machine learning models to scientific discovery and aimed to help in efficient experiment planning and optimization.",

For instance, experiments at LCLS-II-HE will require the X-ray beam to be within a fraction of a micron in diameter, with pointing stability of a few nanoradians, at the end of a kilometer-long electron accelerator, a hundred-meter-long undulator section, and tens of meters long X-ray optics. This enhancement of brightness will increase the data production rate to rival the largest data generators in the world. Without real-time active feedback control and an optimized pipeline to transform measurements to scientific information and insights, researchers will drown in a deluge of mostly useless data, and fail to extract the highly sophisticated insights that the recent brightness upgrades promise. In this article, we outline the strategy we are developing at SLAC to implement Machine Learning driven optimization, automation and real-time knowledge extraction from the electron-injector at the start of the electron accelerator, to the multidimensional X-ray optical systems, and till the experimental endstations and the high readout rate, multi-megapixel detectors at LCLS to deliver the design performance to the users. This is illustrated via examples from Accelerator, Optics and End User applications.",

      "abstract": "A common method for quench protection in accelerator magnets is based on quench protection heaters installed on the coil surfaces. The heaters quickly spread the normal zone across the windings allowing a uniform dissipation of the stored energy. Heater delay is the time required to initiate a normal zone in the coil after heater activation. In high field magnets the heater delays typically range between 5 and 40 ms. Numerical simulations are used for the heater delay prediction while designing the heaters. The simulation models typically include the heater, cable, and insulation layers to compute heat transfer. Challenges arise from numerical stability due to the thin material layers (0.025–0.1 mm) and their temperature-dependent thermal properties. In this study, we created a dataset with heater delay simulations covering a wide range of heater designs and cable parameters relevant for high-field Nb$_{3}$Sn accelerator magnets. We then analysed the data and created a machine learning-based surrogate model that can be used as a stand-alone tool to estimate the heater delay in Nb$_{3}$Sn accelerator magnets with only 7 input parameters. The neural network model provides a fast and user-friendly solution, that is available without investing in numerical model development. The results from the neural network model are very close to the 1D numerical simulations that were used to train the model: the mean absolute error was 0.063 05 ms and R-squared was 0.999 6319. The neural network simulation time is less than 1 s, making it attractive also for integration with other quench protection design software that typically require tens or hundreds of simulations. We also present design graphs that can be used to estimate the heater delay without any computations at all during the first stages of magnet design. The limitation of the model is that it neglects the heater length.",

Our research aims to enhance this cut-based method by employing machine-learning algorithms based on multi-layer perceptrons and boosted decision trees. Similar approaches have been applied in other particle physics experiments and offer an opportunity to increase PID accuracies using reconstructed kinematic data. Our study illustrates that both multilayered perceptrons and boosted decision trees can identify charged and neutral particles in Monte Carlo simulated GlueX data with significantly improved accuracy over the current cuts-based PID method.",

      "abstract": "The fundamental plane (FP) relation connects gamma-ray luminosity to intrinsic pulsar properties, offering the potential to estimate distances for radio-quiet (RQ) gamma-ray pulsars, where direct measurements are often unavailable. The Fermi Third Pulsar Catalog presents spectral data for 294 gamma-ray pulsars, including 72 RQ pulsars, of which only 9 have known distances. This study investigates the FP relation’s potential to predict distances for RQ gamma-ray pulsars using machine learning (ML) approaches. Ordinary least-squares regression was employed alongside ML methods, including random forest and support vector regression, to predict RQ gamma-ray pulsar distances. To ensure robustness, the analysis considered spectral cutoff significance and outlier data. Results confirm that the FP relation is valid only for pulsars exhibiting significant gamma-ray cutoffs, with FP exponents closely matching theoretical expectations. It was shown that gamma-ray emission origins significantly favor the curvature radiation regime over the synchrotron regime at the 4.2σ level. The distances for 62 RQ pulsars, for which no traditional measurements exist, are predicted for the first time. The luminosity and spatial distributions of the considered RQ pulsar population match known pulsar distributions. Predictions for RQ pulsars with known distances are consistent with measured data. This study provides a proof of principle that the FP relation, combined with ML methods, is a promising tool for distance estimation in RQ gamma-ray pulsars, using gamma-ray emission directly for the first time in pulsar distance estimates. Future improvements can be achieved with larger data sets, precise spectral cutoff determinations, and corrections for key factors like the beaming factor.",

However, finding and maintaining optimum settings is a time-consuming expert operator activity. This work proposes the use of the Recurrent Proximal Policy Optimization (RPPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm, to find parameters of quadrupole magnet strengths optimizing the beam qualities in the Booster to AGS (Alternating Gradient Synchrotron) section of the RHIC complex.",

      "abstract": "Particle accelerators are high power complex machines. To ensure uninterrupted operation of these machines, thousands of pieces of equipment need to be synchronized, which requires addressing many challenges including design, optimization and control, anomaly detection and machine protection. With recent advancements, machine learning (ML) holds promise to assist in more advance prognostics, optimization, and control. While ML based solutions have been developed for several applications in particle accelerators, only few have reached deployment and even fewer to long term usage, due to particle accelerator data distribution drifts caused by changes in both measurable and non-measurable parameters. In this paper, we identify some of the key areas within particle accelerators where continual learning can allow maintenance of ML model performance with distribution drifts. Particularly, we first discuss existing applications of ML in particle accelerators, and their limitations due to distribution drift. Next, we review existing continual learning techniques and investigate their potential applications to address data distribution drifts in accelerators. By identifying the opportunities and challenges in applying continual learning, this paper seeks to open up the new field and inspire more research efforts towards deployable continual learning for particle accelerators.",

      "abstract": "Context. A unified explanation of the variety of long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs) is essential for identifying the dissipation mechanism and possibly the nature of their central engines. In the past, a model was proposed to describe GRB LCs as the outcome of a stochastic pulse avalanche process, possibly originating from a turbulent regime, and it was tested by comparing average temporal properties of simulated and real LCs. Recently, we revived this model and optimised its parameters using a genetic algorithm (GA), a machine-learning-based approach. Our findings suggested that GRB inner engines may operate near a critical regime.Aims. Here we present an advanced version of the model, which allows us to constrain the peak flux distribution of individual pulses, and evaluate its performance on a new dataset of GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM).Methods. After introducing new model parameters and a further comparison metric, that is the observed signal-to-noise (S/N) distribution, we test the new model on three complementary datasets: CGRO/BATSE, Swift/BAT, and Fermi/GBM. As in our previous work, the model parameters are optimised using a GA.Results. The updated sets of parameters achieve a further reduction in loss compared to both the original model and our earlier optimisation. The different values of the parameters across the datasets are shown to originate from the different energy passbands, effective areas, trigger algorithms, and, ultimately, different GRB populations of the three experiments.Conclusions. Our results further underpin the stochastic and avalanche character of the dissipation process behind long GRB prompt emission, with an emphasis on the near-critical behaviour, and establish this new model as a reliable tool for generating realistic GRB LCs as they would be seen with future experiments.Key words: methods: data analysis / methods: statistical / gamma-ray burst: general",

To address the impact of noises, we introduced the Kalman filtering method into the orbit feedback system and combined it with the existing neural network framework, creating a dual neural network orbit feedback system. This innovative approach has led to further improvements in overall orbit stability.",

Using \\texttt{Elegant} as the simulation backend, we developed a Python wrapper that simplifies the interaction between RL algorithms and accelerator simulations, enabling seamless input management, simulation execution, and output analysis. The proposed RL framework acts as a co-pilot for physicists, offering intelligent suggestions to enhance beamline performance, reduce tuning time, and improve operational efficiency. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the application of our RL approach to an accelerator control problem and highlight the improvements in efficiency and performance achieved through our methodology. We discuss how the integration of simulation tools with a Python-based RL framework provides a powerful resource for the accelerator physics community, showcasing the potential of machine learning in optimizing complex physical systems.",

The goal is to increase transparency and trust by letting users verify that the agent's decision-making process incorporates suitable physics. Our algorithm uses a learnable surrogate function for physical observables, such as energy, and uses them to fine-tune how actions are chosen. This surrogate can be represented by a neural network or by an interpretable sparse dictionary model. We test our algorithm on a range of particle accelerator controls environments designed to emulate the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson Lab. By examining the mathematical form of the learned constraint function, we are able to confirm the agent has learned to use the established physics of each environment. In addition, we find that the introduction of a physics-based surrogate enables our reinforcement learning algorithms to reliably converge for difficult high-dimensional accelerator controls environments.",

      "abstract": "X-ray free electron lasers (X-FELs) produce ultrafast pulses in a wide range of lasing configurations, supporting a wide variety of scientific applications, including structural biology, materials science, and atomic and molecular physics. Shot-by-shot characterization of the X-FEL pulses is crucial for the analysis of experiments as well as for tuning the X-FEL performance. However, for the weak pulses found in advanced configurations, e.g., those needed for monochromatic, two-pulse studies of quantum materials, there is no current method for reliably resolving pulse profiles. Here, we show that an interpretable neural network (NN) model can reconstruct the individual pulse power profiles for sub-picosecond pulse separation without the need for simulations. Using experimental data from low-signal X-FEL pulse pairs, we demonstrate a NN can learn the pulse characteristics on a shot-by-shot basis when conventional methods fail. This new method enables the characterization of weak pulses—a condition expected to dominate future experimental configurations such as at the Linac Coherent Light Source-II—and opens the door to a wide range of new experiments.",

      ],
      "abstract": "This thesis introduces the Deep Lie Map Network (DLMN), a novel machine-learning-based approach for identifying and correcting nonlinear magnetic field errors in synchrotrons. The DLMN leverages Hamiltonian dynamics and Lie map techniques to model synchrotron optics based on the beam's centroid motion observed using beam position monitors. From the beam centroid's oscillatory motion observed in experiments, the DLMN accurately recovers both quadrupole and sextupole field errors without requiring prior detailed knowledge of the accelerator’s linear optics. The newly developed DLMN is applied in simulations to investigate its ability to resolve gradient and sextupole field errors. Additionally, its robustness against closed orbit distortions, BPM noise, and centroid oscillation decoherence is evaluated through simulations. The DLMN approach is also experimentally validated at the SIS18 synchrotron at Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Germany.Measurements of resonance driving terms and orbit response matrix data are conducted, allowing for comparison with established methods for identifying magnetic field errors.Furthermore, dynamic tune scans of unprecedented quality are conducted, revealing the dominant nonlinear resonances present in SIS18.Experimental results at SIS18 demonstrate that the DLMN can recover both linear and nonlinear optics, including quadrupole and sextupole errors, thus providing a detailed understanding of beam dynamics. The DLMN requires limited measurement time, offering significant advantages over conventional methods such as LOCO (Linear Optics from Closed Orbits), resonance driving term (RDT) analysis, and the Nonlinear Tune Response Matrix (NTRM). This research highlights the DLMN’s ability to recover accurate synchrotron optics models disposable to further simulation studies. Its limited demand for beam time, and thus minimized operational costs, promise its potential to serve as a valuable tool for monitoring the performance of synchrotrons in operations.",

In this article, we present an approach to remove high noise levels and reconstruct up to three failed TOF detectors from an arrangement of 16 TOF detectors.

However, unplanned events such as trips or voltage fluctuations often result in beam outages, causing operational downtime. This downtime not only consumes operator effort in diagnosing and addressing the issue but also leads to unnecessary energy consumption by idle machines awaiting beam restoration. The current threshold-based alarm system is reactive and faces challenges including frequent false alarms and inconsistent outage-cause labeling. To address these limitations, we propose an AI-enabled framework that leverages predictive analytics and automated labeling. Using data from $2,703$ Linac devices and $80$ operator-labeled outages, we evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including recurrent, attention-based, and linear models, for beam outage prediction. Additionally, we assess a Random Forest-based labeling system for providing consistent, confidence-scored outage annotations. Our findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures for beam outage prediction and identify critical gaps that must be addressed to fully harness AI for transitioning downtime handling from reactive to predictive, ultimately reducing downtime and improving decision-making in accelerator management.",

      "abstract": "Gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking models provide a compelling framework for the search for a supersymmetric partner of the tau lepton (stau) with a macroscopic lifetime. In such scenarios, stau can decay to tau lepton displaced from the primary proton-proton interaction vertex. Standard tau reconstruction and identification techniques at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment are not designed for these displaced signatures, motivating the development of specialised approaches.This thesis begins by improving the existing CMS tau identification algorithms for prompt taus using modern machine learning techniques. Building on this foundation, a graph-based neural network is introduced to reliably identify displaced tau leptons, where large displacements pose unique detection challenges. Leveraging this dedicated displaced-tau identification, the first search for the direct production of moderately long-lived stau particles (decaying within the tracker volume) with hadronic taus in the final state is performed using proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The analysis is based on a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb-1, collected by the CMS experiment from 2016 to 2018. This work significantly enhances sensitivity to stau decay lengths of the order of centimetres or more, expanding the experimental coverage of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios.",

We present (i) a survey of state-of-the-art AI/ML techniques tailored for accelerator diagnostics, beam tuning, and anomaly detection; (ii) a case study applying supervised and reinforcement learning strategies to beam optimization in a hypothetical accelerator environment; and (iii) an analysis of the limitations, risks, and integration challenges in real accelerator systems. Our results highlight that AI approaches can significantly reduce tuning time, improve stability under varying operational conditions, and enhance predictive maintenance capabilities. We further discuss how future developments—such as online learning, hybrid physics-ML models, and shared benchmark datasets—could accelerate adoption of AI in accelerator science.

In particular, the electron neutrino appearance channel requires an automated, highly accurate method for selecting electron neutrino interactions from a background of cosmic rays and muon neutrino interactions. In this thesis, we first provide an overview and performance evaluation of SPINE, a deep neural network based reconstruction algorithm for LArTPCs. Building on SPINE output, we then develop an electron neutrino interaction selection algorithm and apply the selection to the 10% unblinded ICARUS Run 2 data, which was collected between December 20th, 2022 and July 14th, 2023.

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for this purpose, addressing the challenges posed by complex detector geometries, high event multiplicities, and noisy data. Traditional methods rely on pattern recognition algorithms like the Kalman filter, but ML techniques, such as neural networks, graph neural networks (GNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), offer improved accuracy and scalability. By learning from simulated and real detector data, ML models can identify and classify tracks, predict trajectories, and handle ambiguities caused by overlapping or missing hits. Moreover, ML-based approaches can process data in near-real-time, enhancing the efficiency of experiments at large-scale facilities like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Jefferson Lab (JLAB). As detector technologies and computational resources evolve, ML-driven charged track reconstruction continues to push the boundaries of precision and discovery in nuclear physics.In these proceedings, we highlight advancements in charged track identification leveraging Artificial Intelligence within the CLAS12 detector, achieving a notable enhancement in experimental statistics compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we showcase real-time event reconstruction capabilities, including the inference of charged particle properties, such as momentum, direction, and species identification, at speeds matching data acquisition rates.

      "abstract": "Polarized cryo-targets and polarized photon beams are widely used in experiments at Jefferson Lab. Traditional methods for maintaining the optimal polarization involve manual adjustments throughout data taking by human shift takers. This may introduce some level of inconsistency simply due to the wide variety of experience and expertise of the shift takers themselves. Implementing machine learning-based control systems can improve the stability of the polarization without relying on human intervention. The cryo-target polarization is influenced by temperature, microwave energy, the distribution of paramagnetic radicals, as well as operational conditions including the radiation dose. Diamond radiators are used to generate linearly polarized photons from a primary electron beam. The energy spectrum of these photons can drift over time due to changes in the primary electron beam conditions and diamond degradation. As a first step towards automating the continuous optimization and control processes, uncertainty aware surrogate models have been developed to predict the polarization based on historical data. This talk will provide an overview of the use cases and models developed, highlighting the collaboration between data scientists and physicists at Jefferson Lab.",

Our research focuses on mitigating instabilities, particularly timing jitter, which critically impacts the quality of accelerated beams. Through the deployment of Impact-T, Bmad, and Tao simulation tools at the FACET-II facility, we examined how timing jitter influences key beam parameters, including peak currents and emittance, over various simulation scenarios. The findings reveal that even minute variations in accelerator settings can significantly influence beam characteristics, underscoring the importance of precise control in beam dynamics. The outcomes contribute to enhancing the reliability and precision of PWFA systems, promising improved applications in both scientific research and medical therapies. Future research directions include integrating machine learning techniques to refine control strategies further and reduce experimental redundancies, highlighting the evolving synergy between accelerator physics and computational data science.",

For complicated large scale machines such as accelerators, the inner mappings between control parameters and performance data are often only partially known, but they can be learned and simulated using machine learning methods without extensive physics understandings. In this dissertation, two major types of machine learning techniques were developed for and demonstrated on several accelerators located at Cornell University and Brookhaven National Laboratory: neural network design for constructing accurate mappings between control parameters and performance data, and optimization algorithm development for finding optimal operation parameters automatically. These successful applications show the benefits of integrating machine learning algorithms with accelerator control system, and build the foundation for including similar techniques in the ongoing development and construction of the Electron Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory.",

This comprehension is crucial for the functioning of modern hadron synchrotrons like the CERN Large Hadron Collider and the planning of future ones such as the Future Circular Collider. The dynamic aperture defines the extent of the region in phase space where the trajectories of charged particles are bounded over numerous revolutions, the actual number being defined by the physical application. Traditional methods for calculating the dynamic aperture depend on computationally demanding numerical simulations, which require tracking over multiple turns of numerous initial conditions appropriately distributed in phase space. Prior research has shown the efficiency of a multilayer perceptron network in forecasting the dynamic aperture of the CERN Large Hadron Collider ring, achieving a remarkable speed-up of up to 200-fold compared to standard numerical tracking tools. Building on recent advancements, we conducted a comparative study of various deep learning networks based on BERT, DenseNet, ResNet and VGG architectures. The results demonstrate substantial enhancements in the prediction of the dynamic aperture, marking a significant advancement in the development of more precise and efficient surrogate models of beam dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Electron beam accelerators are essential in many scientific and technological fields. Their operation relies heavily on the stability and precision of the electron beam. Traditional diagnostic techniques encounter difficulties in addressing the complex and dynamic nature of electron beams. Particularly in the context of free-electron lasers (FELs), it is fundamentally impossible to measure the lasing-on and lasingoff electron power profiles for a single electron bunch. This is a crucial hurdle in the exact reconstruction of the photon pulse profile. To overcome this hurdle, we developed a machine learning model that predicts the temporal power profile of the electron bunch in the lasing-off regime using machine parameters that can be obtained when lasing is on. The model was statistically validated and showed superior predictions compared to the state-of-the-art batch calibrations. The work we present here is a critical element for a virtual pulse reconstruction diagnostic (VPRD) tool designed to reconstruct the power profile of individual photon pulses without requiring repeated measurements in the lasing-off regime. This promises to significantly enhance the diagnostic capabilities in FELs at large.",

      "abstract": "A third-integer resonant slow extraction system is being developed for Fermilab's Delivery Ring to deliver protons to the upcoming Mu2e experiment. The timescale of the extraction (or spill) duration is 43 milliseconds, which is extremely short and unprecedented. Additionally, the experiment's strict and challenging requirements on the quality of the spill at this time scale has led to the development of a new Spill Regulation System (SRS) design. The SRS primarily consists of three components - slow regulation, fast regulation, and harmonic content suppressor. Contributions to the first two components of the SRS, i.e., Slow Regulation and Fast Regulation subsystems, will be presented in which new adaptive learning algorithm schemes for the slow regulation of the spill -- validated using particle tracking simulations -- shall be described. In addition to these novel methods for the enhancement of the spill regulation system, results of employing Machine Learning in enhancing the performance of the resonant extraction are also presented. At the forefront of applying ML techniques to solve non-linear accelerator control problems, this work includes optimizing the PID gains as well as the replacement of the traditional PID controller using Recurrent Neural Networks and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) ML models to achieve efficiencies greater than a PID controller. Cutting-edge on-going Reinforcement Learning efforts, including an actor-critic family of learning algorithms, to regulate the spill rate will be reviewed, as well as present analytical calculations pertaining the transit time of particles in a third-integer resonant extraction. Detailed numerical investigations and validations of such calculations, the model of which could be exported and reliably used in future analytical modeling of any resonant extraction, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Particle accelerator operation requires simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is particularly challenging due to trade-offs between the objectives. Evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms (GAs), have been leveraged for many optimization problems, however, they do not apply to complex control problems by design. This paper demonstrates the power of differentiability for solving MOO problems in particle accelerators using a deep differentiable reinforcement learning (DDRL) algorithm. We compare the DDRL algorithm with model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL), GA, and Bayesian optimization (BO) for simultaneous optimization of heat load and trip rates in the continuous electron beam accelerator facility. The underlying problem enforces strict constraints on both individual states and actions as well as cumulative (global) constraints on energy requirements of the beam. Using historical accelerator data, we develop a physics-based surrogate model which is differentiable and allows for back-propagation of gradients. The results are evaluated in the form of a Pareto-front with two objectives. We show that the DDRL outperforms MFRL, BO, and GA on high dimensional problems.",

Among these, the emittance and Twiss parameters—defining the size, shape, and orientation of the beam in phase space—serve as important indicators of beam quality. Prior studies have shown that carefully calibrated statistical methods can extract emittance and Twiss parameters from pepper-pot emittance meter images. Our research aimed to retrieve these parameters with machine learning (ML) from a transverse image of the beam after its propagation through a pepper-pot grid and subsequent contact with a scintillating plate. We applied a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the x and y emittances and Twiss parameters (α and β), producing a six-dimensional output by simply looking at the image without calibration information. The extraction of divergence-dependent parameters, such as α and emittance, from a single image presented a challenge, resulting in a large Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) of 30%. To mitigate this issue, our novel method that incorporated image data from two points along the particles' propagation path yielded promising results. β prediction achieved a low SMAPE of 3%, while α and emittance predictions were realized with a 15% SMAPE. Our findings suggest the potential for improvement in ML beam quality assessment through multi-point image data analysis.",

However, it is difficult to solve high dimensional optimization problems using current beam dynamics simulations because calculating gradients of simulated objectives with respect to input parameters is computationally expensive in high dimensions. To address this problem, backwards differentiable beam dynamics simulations have been developed that enable computationally inexpensive calculations of objective gradients that are independent of the number of input parameters. In this work, we highlight current and future applications of differentiable beam dynamics simulations in accelerator physics, such as improving accelerator design, model calibration, and machine learning. We also describe current collaborative efforts between SLAC, DESY, KIT, and LBNL to implement fast, backwards differentiable beam dynamics simulations in Python. These tools will enable unprecedented improvements in optimization efficiency and speed when using beam dynamics simulations, leading to enhanced control and detailed understanding of physical accelerator systems.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) tools have been growing in popularity for accelerator applications, but still struggle with time varying systems, for which they require lengthy brute-force re-training. LANL has developed generative machine learning (ML)-based tools, that utilize adaptive model independent feedback control theory together with hard physics constraints, to make the tools much more robust to distribution shift. These adaptive ML tools are able to extrapolate much further beyond the span of the training data and are thus much more robust for time-varying systems. This talk will give a broad overview of the challenges of various time-varying accelerator systems at various accelerator facilities (known as systems with distribution shift in the ML community) and will present adaptive ML tools for 6D phase space diagnostics of intense charged particle beams. The talk will give a general overview of diffusion-based generative models and also adaptive latent space tuning, which is the novel method we have developed for adaptive ML, and how we are strictly enforcing hard physics constraints in our ML tools, which traditional ML tools lack. We demonstrate our general methods for various accelerators: the 5-meter long ultra-fast electron diffraction (UED) HiRES compact accelerator at LBNL, the ~kilometer long plasma wakefield accelerator FACET-II at SLAC, and the LANL ion accelerator LANSCE.",

      "abstract": "Understanding and predicting complex dynamics in accelerators is necessary for their successful operation. A grand challenge in accelerator physics is to develop predictive virtual accelerators that mitigate design cost and schedule risk. Data-driven techniques greatly appeal to generating virtual accelerators due to their limited dimensionality compared with first-principle simulation, yet require significant up-front investment and lack interpretability in the context of governing equations. This paper uses an alternative, interpretable, data-driven technique called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) developed by University of Washington researchers to study nonlinear beam centroid dynamics excited by realistic beam injection. We propose evolution equations based solely on data analysis and intuition of the underlying lattice structure, without recourse to an underlying first-principles centroid model nor the actual lattice forcing functions. We do this to mimic an application environment where analytic models are inadequate or where detailed lattice forcing functions are unknown. In the context of the accurate centroid model, we report and interpret SINDy's beam evolution equations learned from the training data and show favorable prediction results. We compare with an alternative machine learning model used on the same training data and contrast its prediction ability, computational expense, and interpretability with SINDy's results.",

      "abstract": "The discovery of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is a major subject of many experiments, such as the ATLAS and CMS experiments with the Large Hadron Collider, which has the world's highest centre-of-mass energy.　Many types of BSM models have been proposed to solve the issues of the Standard Model.　Many of them have some or many model parameters, e.g. the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which is one of the most famous BSM models, has more than 100 model parameters.　These model parameters are free parameters; they cannot be predicted from theories and need to be determined experimentally.Data analysis of BSM model searches involves comparing observed experimental data with a particular BSM model.　If the BSM model parameters are multidimensional, it is difficult to perform an analysis covering the whole phase space.　Instead, it is often performed by fixing all the model parameters except for one or two interesting parameters to focus on, or by using community defined benchmark points, resulting in phase space holes that are not covered by the search.This talk presents a parameter scan technique for BSM signal models based on normalizing flow.　Normalizing flow is a type of deep learning model that transforms a simple probability distribution into a complex probability distribution as an invertible function.　By learning an invertible transformation between a complex multidimensional distribution, such as experimental data observed in collider experiments, and a multidimensional normal distribution, the normalizing flow model gains the ability to sample (or generate) pseudo experimental data from random numbers and to evaluate a log-likelihood value from multidimensional observed events.　The normalizing flow model can also be extended to take multidimensional conditional variables as arguments.　Thus, the normalizing flow model can be used as a generator and evaluator of pseudo experimental data conditioned by the BSM model parameters.　The log-likelihood value, the output of the normalizing flow model, is a function of the conditional variables.　Therefore, the model can quickly calculate gradients of the log-likelihood to the conditional variables.　Following this property, it is expected that the most likely set of conditional variables that reproduce the experimental data, i.e. the optimal set of parameters for the BSM model, can be efficiently searched.　This paper demonstrates this on a simple dataset and discusses its limitations and future extensions.",

This paper envisions a paradigm shift: a decentralized multi-agent framework for accelerator control, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and distributed among autonomous agents. We present a proposition of a self-improving decentralized system where intelligent agents handle high-level tasks and communication and each agent is specialized to control individual accelerator components. This approach raises some questions: What are the future applications of AI in particle accelerators? How can we implement an autonomous complex system such as a particle accelerator where agents gradually improve through experience and human feedback? What are the implications of integrating a human-in-the-loop component for labeling operational data and providing expert guidance? We show three examples, where we demonstrate the viability of such architecture.",

Improving signal processing for thesemachines will improve cost and time margins for deployment, helpingto meet the growing demand for accelerators for medicalsterilization, food irradiation, cancer treatment, and imaging.

We demonstrate the construction of surrogate models using machine learning technique for a laser-plasma injector (LPI) electron source based on more than 12000 simulations of a laser wakefield acceleration performed for sparsely spaced input parameters [1]. Surrogate models are very interesting for LPI design and optimisation because they are much faster than PIC simulations. We develop and compare the performance of three surrogate models, namely, Gaussian processes (GP), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and decision trees (DT). We then use the best surrogate model to quickly find optimal working points to get a selected electron beam energy, charge and energy spread using different methods, namely random search, Bayesian optimisation and multi-objective Bayesian optimisation",

Beam Steering is an essential task for light sources. The Linac To Undulator is very difficult to steer and aim due to the changes of each use of the accelerator there must be re-calibration of magnets. However with each use of the Beamline its current method of steering runs into issues when faced with calibrating angles and positions. Human operators spend a substantial amount of time and resources on the task. We developed multiple different feed-forward-neural networks with varying hyper-parameters, inputs, and outputs, seeking to compare their performance. Specifically, our smaller models with 33 inputs and 13 outputs outperformed the larger models with 73 inputs and 50 outputs. We propose the following explanations for this lack of performance in larger models. First, a lack of training time and computational power limited the ability of our models to mature. Given more time, our models would outperform SVD. Second, when the input size of the model increases the noise increases as well. In this case more inputs corresponded to a greater length upon the LINAC accelerator. Less specific and larger models that seek to make more predictions will inherently perform worse than SVD.",

      "abstract": "We report on the recovery of both linear and nonlinear optics in a hadron synchrotron using the novel deep Lie map network (DLMN) approach. The DLMN enables the construction of a detailed accelerator model by integrating charged particle dynamics with machine learning methods within a data-driven framework. The primary observable is the centroid motion over a limited number of turns, captured by beam position monitors. The DLMN generates an updated description of the accelerator in terms of magnetic multipole components, which can be directly utilized in established accelerator physics tools and tracking codes for further analysis. In this study, the DLMN approach is employed to recover a linear optics model, including gradient errors, from a single measured trajectory. Nonlinear optics, including sextupole errors, are recovered using three measured trajectories. We assess the validity of these results by comparison with the linear optics from closed orbits algorithm and through estimates of resonance driving terms. Additionally, we illustrate an application of the deep Lie map network and the predicted synchrotron optics by comparing measured and simulated tune scans.",

      "abstract": "Traditional cosmic ray filtering algorithms used in X-ray imaging detectors aboard space telescopes perform event reconstruction based on the properties of activated pixels above a certain energy threshold, within 3×3 or 5×5 pixel sliding windows. This approach can reject up to 98% of the cosmic ray background. However, the remaining unrejected background constitutes a significant impediment to studies of low surface brightness objects, which are especially prevalent in the high-redshift universe. The main limitation of the traditional filtering algorithms is their ignorance of the long-range contextual information present in image frames. This becomes particularly problematic when analyzing signals created by secondary particles produced during interactions of cosmic rays with body of the detector. Such signals may look identical to the energy deposition left by X-ray photons, when one considers only the properties within the small sliding window. Additional information is present, however, in the spatial and energy correlations between signals in different parts of the same frame, which can be accessed by modern machine learning (ML) techniques. In this work, we continue the development of an ML-based pipeline for cosmic ray background mitigation. Our latest method consist of two stages: first, a frame classification neural network is used to create class activation maps (CAM), localizing all events within the frame; second, after event reconstruction, a random forest classifier, using features obtained from CAMs, is used to separate X-ray and cosmic ray features. The method delivers &gt; 40% relative improvement over traditional filtering in background rejection in standard 0.3-10 keV energy range, at the expense of only a small (&lt; 2%) level of lost X-ray signal. Our method also provides a convenient way to tune the cosmic ray rejection threshold to adapt to a user’s specific scientific needs.",

The plant utilizes 800 superconducting radio-frequency cavities in order to accelerate electron bunches to high energies of up to 17.5 GeV. Various faulty events can disrupt the nominal functioning of the accelerator, including quenches that can lead to a loss of the superconductivity of the cavities and the interruption of their operation. In this context, our solution consists in analyzing signals reflecting the dynamics of the cavities in a two-stage approach. (I) Fault detection that uses analytical redundancy to process the data and generate a residual. The evaluation of the residual through the generalized likelihood ratio allows detecting the faulty behaviors. (II) Fault isolation which involves the distinction of the quenches from the other faults. To this end, we proceed with a data-driven model of the k-medoids algorithm that explores different similarity measures, namely, the Euclidean and the dynamic time warping. Finally, we evaluate the new method and compare it to the currently deployed quench detection system, the results show the improved performance achieved by our method.",

Autonomous tuning is a rapidly expanding field of research, where learning-based methods like Bayesian optimisation (BO) hold great promise in improving plant performance and reducing tuning times. At the same time, reinforcement learning (RL) is a capable method of learning intelligent controllers, and recent work shows that RL can also be used to train domain-specialised optimisers in so-called reinforcement learning-trained optimisation (RLO). In parallel efforts, both algorithms have found successful adoption in particle accelerator tuning. Here we present a comparative case study, assessing the performance of both algorithms while providing a nuanced analysis of the merits and the practical challenges involved in deploying them to real-world facilities. Our results will help practitioners choose a suitable learning-based tuning algorithm for their tuning tasks, accelerating the adoption of autonomous tuning algorithms, ultimately improving the availability of particle accelerators and pushing their operational limits.",

An initial machine-learning (ML) model for the reconstruction of the longitudinal distribution has been extended to extract the main parameters of multiple bunches at LHC injection. The extended model utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture to analyze sets of longitudinal profile measurements. Its development was partially driven by the need of a real-time beam energy error estimate, which was not directly available in the past. The derived beam parameters moreover include injection phase error, bunch length and intensity in the LHC, as well as the RF voltages at extraction from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and at capture in the LHC. In this paper, we compare the results of the ML model with conventional measurements of bunch length and energy error, from the beam quality monitor (BQM) and the orbit acquisition system, respectively. These benchmarks demonstrate the potential of applying the ML model for operational exploitation in LHC.",

The development is aiming to enhance the prediction of anomalies, leading to reduced life cycles of these beam transfer equipment. For this reason, the standard vacuum operated, direct drive septa magnet has been chosen to investigate critical design features. In the initial project phase, a so called High-Fidelity (HF) numerical simulation has been carried out, providing insight on critical components, like brazed joints, reducing the fatigue life. In parallel a dedicated test setup with state-of-the-art instrumentation has been developed, allowing to confirm the predicted system response. The novel approach for the beam transfer equipment will allow to review presently established design criteria. In a further iteration, the project is now aiming to demonstrate an anomaly detection and their prediction based on novel machine learning techniques. This paper presents the initial phase of developing the HF model, as well as the results of the instrumented magnet tests which will be compared to results from the numerical simulations.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a unique learning paradigm that is particularly well-suited to tackle complex control tasks, can deal with delayed consequences, and can learn from experience without an explicit model of the dynamics of the problem. These properties make RL methods extremely promising for applications in particle accelerators, where the dynamically evolving conditions of both the particle beam and the accelerator systems must be constantly considered. While the time to work on RL is now particularly favorable thanks to the availability of high-level programming libraries and resources, its implementation in particle accelerators is not trivial and requires further consideration. In this context, the Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Accelerators (RL4AA) international collaboration was established to consolidate existing knowledge, share experiences and ideas, and collaborate on accelerator-specific solutions that leverage recent advances in RL. Here we report on two collaboration workshops, RL4AA'23 and RL4AA'24, which took place in February 2023 at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and in February 2024 at the Paris-Lodron Universität Salzburg.",

      "abstract": "Particle accelerators rely on high-precision simulations to optimize beam dynamics. These simulations are computationally expensive, making real-time analysis impractical. This thesis seeks to address this limitation by exploring the potential of machine learning to develop surrogate models for particle accelerator simulations. The focus is on ThomX, a compact Compton source, where two surrogate models are introduced: LinacNet and Implicit Neural ODE (INODE). These models are trained on a comprehensive database developed in this thesis that captures a wide range of operating conditions to ensure robustness and generalizability. LinacNet provides a comprehensive representation of the particle cloud by predicting all coordinates of the macro-particles, rather than focusing solely on beam observables. This detailed modeling, coupled with a sequential approach that accounts for cumulative particle dynamics throughout the accelerator, ensures consistency and enhances model interpretability. INODE, based on the Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) framework, seeks to learn the implicit governing dynamics of particle systems without the need for explicit ODE solving during training. Unlike traditional NODEs, which struggle with discontinuities, INODE is theoretically designed to handle them more effectively. Together, LinacNet and INODE serve as surrogate models for ThomX, demonstrating their ability to approximate particle dynamics. This work lays the groundwork for developing and improving the reliability of machine learning-based models in accelerator physics.",

To meet those, it is necessary to optimize or develop new methods for the control systems. One of the difficulties lies in the relatively long computation time of current beam dynamics codes. In this context, the very low computation time of neural network is of great attraction. However, a neural network has to be trained in order to be of any use. The training of a beam dynamic predictor uses a large dataset (experimental or simulated) that represents the dynamics over the parameter space of interest. Therefore, choosing the right training dataset is crucial for the quality of the neural network predictions. In this work, a study on the sampling choice for the training data is performed to train a neural network to predict the transmission of a beam through a low energy beam transport line and a Radiofrequency Quadrupole. We show and discuss the results obtained on training data set to model the IPHI and MYRRHA injectors.",

A detailed understanding of their impact often remains elusive since these factors cannot be studied independently. Formulating reliability studies as a Bayesian regression problem allows to simultaneously assess their impact and to identify a predictive model of reliability metrics.The proposed method is applied to currently operational particle accelerator equipment at CERN. Relevant metrics were gathered by combining data from various organizational databases. To obtain predictive models, different supervised machine learning algorithms were applied and compared in terms of their prediction error and reliability. Results show that the identified models accurately predict the mean-time-between-failure of devices – an important reliability metric for repairable systems - and reveal factors which lead to increased dependability. These results provide valuable inputs for early development stages of highly dependable equipment for future particle accelerators.",

Recurrent networks are better fitted to extrapolation tasks while the reservoir echo-state structure is computationally effective. Model training and validation is conducted on a set of &quot;seeds&quot; corresponding to the simulation results of different machine configurations.

A precise estimation of the space charge is required to understand the potential errors causing the difference between simulations and reality. Unfortunately, the space charge is computationally expensive, needing the simulation of a few dozen thousand particles to obtain an accurate prediction. This paper presents a Machine Learning-based approximation of the simulator output, a.k.a. surrogate model. Such an inexpensive surrogate model can support multiple experiments in parallel, allowing the wide exploration of the simulator control parameters. While the state of the art is limited to considering a few such parameters with a restricted range, the proposed approach, LinacNet, scales up to one hundred parameters with wide domains. LinacNet uses a large-size particle cloud to represent the beam and estimates the particle behavior using a dedicated neural network architecture reflecting the architecture of a Linac and its different physical regimes.",

ML allows for the automated interpretation of experimental results, particularly those obtained from synchrotron or neutron facilities. The speed at which ML models can process data presents an important opportunity to establish a closed-loop feedback system, enabling real-time decision-making based on online data analysis. In this study, we describe the incorporation of ML into a closed-loop workflow for X-ray reflectometry (XRR), using the growth of organic thin films as an example. Our focus lies on the beamline integration of ML-based online data analysis and closed-loop feedback. We present solutions that provide an elementary data analysis in real time during the experiment without introducing the additional software dependencies in the beamline control software environment. Our data demonstrates the accuracy and robustness of ML methods for analyzing XRR curves and Bragg reflections and its autonomous control over a vacuum deposition setup.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning framework plays an important role in connecting hardware platform and algorithm. In recent years, some domain-specific deep learning accelerators with better performance and energy efficiency were proposed by researchers. However, current frameworks lack enough considerations about how to better support the possible new features brought by accelerators. In this paper, we propose to build a performance portable programming framework with subgraph extraction. The intuition is that increasing ratio of optimizations are taken from the top-level framework to the low-level software stack of accelerator. In response to this development trend, framework needs to pay more attention to the splitting strategy of computation graph for the heterogeneous computation.",

We present highlights in Exascale Computing to scale accelerator modeling software to the requirements set for contemporary science drivers. In particular, we present the first laser-plasma modeling on an exaflop supercomputer using the US DOE Exascale Computing Project WarpX. Leveraging developments for Exascale, the new DOE SCIDAC-5 Consortium for Advanced Modeling of Particle Accelerators (CAMPA) will advance numerical algorithms and accelerate community modeling codes in a cohesive manner: from beam source, over energy boost, transport, injection, storage, to application or interaction. Such start-to-end modeling will enable the exploration of hybrid accelerators, with conventional and advanced elements, as the next step for advanced accelerator modeling. Following open community standards, we seed an open ecosystem of codes that can be readily combined with each other and machine learning frameworks. These will cover ultrafast to ultraprecise modeling for future hybrid accelerator design, even enabling virtual test stands and twins of accelerators that can be used in operations.",

      "abstract": "New developments at synchrotron beamlines and the ongoing upgrades of synchrotron facilities allow the possibility to study complex structures with a much better spatial and temporal resolution than ever before. However, the downside is that the data collected are also significantly larger (more than several terabytes) than ever before, and post-processing and analyzing these data is very challenging to perform manually. This issue can be solved by employing automated methods such as machine learning, which show significantly improved performance in data processing and image segmentation than manual methods. In this work, a 3D U-net deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model with four layers and base-8 characteristic features has been developed to segment precipitates and porosities in synchrotron transmission X-ray micrograms. Transmission X-ray microscopy experiments were conducted on micropillars prepared from additively manufactured 316L steel to evaluate precipitate information. After training the 3D U-net DCNN model, it was used on unseen data and the prediction was compared with manual segmentation. A good agreement was found between both segmentations. An ablation study was performed and revealed that the proposed model showed better statistics than other models with lower numbers of layers and/or characteristic features. The proposed model is able to segment several hundreds of gigabytes of data in a few minutes and could be applied to other materials and tomography techniques. The code and the fitted weights are made available with this paper for any interested researcher to use for their needs (https://github.com/manasvupadhyay/erc-gamma-3D-DCNN).",

      "abstract": "Recent developments in synchrotron radiation facilities have increased the amount of data generated during acquisitions considerably, requiring fast and efficient data processing techniques. Here, the application of dense neural networks (DNNs) to data treatment of X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) experiments is presented. Processing involves mapping the phases in a tomographic slice by predicting the phase fraction in each individual pixel. DNNs were trained on sets of calculated XRD patterns generated using a Python algorithm developed in-house. An initial Rietveld refinement of the tomographic slice sum pattern provides additional information (peak widths and integrated intensities for each phase) to improve the generation of simulated patterns and make them closer to real data. A grid search was used to optimize the network architecture and demonstrated that a single fully connected dense layer was sufficient to accurately determine phase proportions. This DNN was used on the XRD-CT acquisition of a mock-up and a historical sample of highly heterogeneous multi-layered decoration of a late medieval statue, called `applied brocade'. The phase maps predicted by the DNN were in good agreement with other methods, such as non-negative matrix factorization and serial Rietveld refinements performed with TOPAS , and outperformed them in terms of speed and efficiency. The method was evaluated by regenerating experimental patterns from predictions and using the R -weighted profile as the agreement factor. This assessment allowed us to confirm the accuracy of the results.",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As a critical supporting component in geotechnical engineering structures such as bridges, tunnels, and highways, the anchorage quality of bolts directly impacts their structural safety. The ultrasonic guided wave method is a popular method for the non-destructive testing of anchorage quality. However, noise from complex field environments, modal mixing caused by anchoring interface reflections, and dispersion effects make it challenging to directly extract defect features from guided wave signals in the time or frequency domains. To address these challenges, this study proposes a solution based on the combination of the guided wave time–frequency spectrum and the gated attention residual network (GA-ResNet). The GA-ResNet introduces a gating mechanism to balance spatial attention and channel attention, and it is used for anchoring model type recognition. Experiments were conducted on four types of anchorage models, and the time–frequency spectrum was selected to be the input feature. The results demonstrate that the GA-ResNet can effectively predict the anchorage bolt defect type and prevent potential safety accidents.</jats:p>",

We present a comprehensive digital twin framework uniquely combining a fully differentiable fast beam transport code with neural network surrogates trained on high-fidelity PIC simulations, capturing space charge and nonlinear dynamics beyond traditional envelope codes while achieving 10&#8308;× speedup at <1% accuracy. End-to-end differentiability enables gradient-based optimization across 500+ parameters simultaneously—previously impossible with conventional tools—while the model incorporates static/dynamic errors and serves as a virtual commissioning platform for diverse hardware integration. The framework facilitates reinforcement learning for pulsed/CW mode transitions, predictive maintenance through anomaly detection, and autonomous tuning algorithm development with real-time execution capability. Validation against physics simulations shows excellent agreement for the front-end, with initial results demonstrating potential for 30% commissioning time reduction and proactive fault mitigation, providing a scalable blueprint for operating next-generation high-intensity accelerators.",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article proposes a framework based on differential evolution algorithm and bidirectional long short-term memory network to optimize Transformer, providing an intelligent solution for 5G base station RF module fault prediction. Through variable correlation analysis, it can be concluded that the modulation efficiency (0.19) has the strongest positive correlation with fault_type, while the operation time (-0.08) has the strongest negative correlation with fault_type. After comparing the framework with models such as decision tree, random forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and ExtraTrees, it was found that DE BiLSTM Transformer had significantly better comprehensive performance in 5G base station RF module fault classification prediction: its accuracy reached 0.956, higher than XGBoost and LightGBM's 0.925, ExtraTrees' 0.921, random forest's 0.904, decision tree's 0.864, and CatBoost's 0.798, indicating a significant lead in overall classification accuracy; The recall rate is 0.956, which can more comprehensively identify actual fault samples; The accuracy rate is 0.958, only slightly lower than the 0.919 of random forest, far higher than the 0.9 of XGBoost and 0.86 of LightGBM, demonstrating outstanding ability to accurately identify fault types; The F1 value of 0.941 and AUC value of 0.979 are also the highest, showing better performance in balancing accuracy and recall, distinguishing between faulty and non faulty samples. This advantage stems from the synergistic effect of optimizing model parameters with differential evolution algorithm, capturing bidirectional temporal features with BiLSTM, and focusing on key features with Transformer self attention mechanism, making it more suitable for complex feature correlation scenarios in RF module fault prediction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n                <p>In many modern search systems, users often do not know the exact name or formal description of the content or item they are seeking, which frequently leads to inefficient or unsuccessful searches. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-learning search engine that leverages collective user behavior to address this challenge. The proposed algorithm is capable of learning from colloquial, incomplete, or seemingly meaningless queries and dynamically mapping them to relevant content items. By recording queries and analyzing user click patterns, the system automatically generates dynamic aliases for content, continuously enhancing its internal database over time without relying on complex natural language understanding. Extensive simulations and experiments demonstrate that the method achieves a high matching accuracy between diverse user queries and intended content, outperforming traditional fuzzy search and semantic search approaches, especially in scenarios where users are unable to provide precise or standardized search terms. This approach not only improves search relevance but also enables the system to adapt to evolving user behaviors and diverse linguistic expressions. The proposed framework represents a practical, scalable, and adaptive solution for search engines, recommendation systems, and other content discovery platforms, highlighting the potential of behavior-driven self-learning in improving user experience and information retrieval efficiency.</p>",

In response, TRIUMF has launched a program focused on automating beam tuning and delivery across its accelerator complex. This initiative includes high-level applications, model-based tuning of the accelerator, and the integration of machine learning tools. For example, Bayesian optimization is used to correct beam orbits within the TRIUMF accelerators. This presentation will provide an overview of the program's progress and highlight some exciting new results achieved over the past two years.",

While its role in risk stratification is well-established, its utility in predicting functional myocardial ischemia remains underexplored. This study aimed to develop a novel machine learning model that predicts ischemia based solely on the quantitative analysis of coronary calcifications in CTCS scans.\n                  </jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\n                    <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold>\n                    We retrospectively analyzed 987 patients who underwent both non-contrast CTCS and regadenoson stress cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging with an NH\n                    <jats:sub>3</jats:sub>\n                    tracer within one year at the University Hospitals of Cleveland. A total of 75 features were extracted, including 4 clinical variables, the total Agatston score, and 70 calcium-omics features. Calcium-omics encompassed metrics from individual calcifications (e.g., mass score), arterial territories (e.g., lesion count), and whole-heart regions (e.g., histogram-based Hounsfield unit statistics). Feature selection was performed using CatBoost with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to identify the most predictive subset. A CatBoost classifier was then trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, repeated 1,000 times to ensure robust performance estimates.\n                  </jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\n                    <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>\n                    Among the 987 patients, 89 (9.0%) had PET-confirmed ischemia. From the 75 original features, the top 9 predictors were selected using CatBoost and SHAP, including the total Agatston score and 8 calcium-omics features. The final model achieved excellent predictive performance, with a precision of 88.7±8.1%, sensitivity of 78.8±8.6%, specificity of 97.9±1.0%, F1 score of 82.9±5.4%, and an area under the curve of 91.1±4.1%. Compared to models using only clinical features (precision 13.2±3.7% and F1 score 21.3±5.3%) or clinical features plus the Agatston score (precision 74.7±9.5% and F1 score 76.4±6.7%), the inclusion of calcium-omics features significantly improved predictive performance (\n                    <jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">p</jats:italic>\n                    &lt;0.05), particularly by reducing false positives.\n                  </jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\n                    <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold>\n                    We developed a novel machine learning approach for predicting myocardial ischemia using non-contrast CTCS imaging. Our findings suggest that calcium-omics features provide additional predictive value beyond traditional Agatston scoring and may support more cost-effective patient triage by reducing unnecessary downstream testing, especially in low-risk populations.\n                  </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Ensuring data integrity via data quality monitoring (DQM) is critical in large-scale particle physics experiments. This traditionally relies on labor-intensive manual inspection or static machine learning models, which are adequate for stable operating conditions. However, the current era of major detector upgrades at the large hadron collider (LHC) challenges this paradigm. These upgrades are followed by prolonged commissioning periods with frequent and unpredictable changes in detector conditions, a regime for which static models are ill-suited. To address this, we reframe DQM as a dynamic decision-making problem and introduce a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RLHL) framework. Our proximal policy optimization agent learns both to classify data and to strategically decide when to query human experts, optimizing the automation-oversight balance. On synthetic data, the system rapidly adapts to abrupt condition changes and successfully learns from noisy labels. In a simulated online regime, the agent minimizes human intervention by requesting it mainly when its uncertainty is high. A preliminary study on a real offline dataset from the LHCb experiment demonstrates that our synthetic approach is a reasonable proxy for real-world scenarios. The algorithm generalizes effectively with only superficial hyperparameter tuning, robustly identifying anomalies even when trained on augmented data. This work presents a scalable, adaptive solution for semi-autonomous DQM.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Insulators are critical components in transmission lines. Common defects, such as structural loss of the insulator caused by spontaneous rupture, breakage, and fouling can lead to short circuits and tripping faults, posing serious threats to power grid stability and the safety of the power supply. However, in practical applications, insulator defect detection faces several challenges, including small target sizes, insufficient representation of multiscale features, complex backgrounds, and imbalanced datasets with a limited number of defective samples. Traditional detection methods often struggle with missed detections of small targets and lack robustness in scenarios with large-scale variations and complex environments. To address these issues, this paper proposes an enhanced detection model based on YOLOv8s. The model introduces an iterative attentional feature fusion module to optimize multiscale feature representation and incorporates a Generalized Dynamic Feature Pyramid Network (GDFPN) to improve feature retention for small target detection, thereby enhancing robustness in complex backgrounds. Additionally, to mitigate the problem of limited defective sample data, the Stable Diffusion generative model is utilized to augment the dataset, effectively improving detection performance in small-sample scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the original YOLOv8s model in terms of recall, accuracy, and precision on the insulator defect dataset. The model exhibits strong detection capabilities and generalization performance, making it well-suited for real-world challenges such as small targets, multiscale variation, and complex backgrounds.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation wireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision localization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution techniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection, while generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models that lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a Symbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained symbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam pattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER achieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and interpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a controlled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of the known $\\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5 degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further reduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that lack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a real-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed. SABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with near-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cramér-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and accurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA estimation.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n                <p>The rapid evolution of sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks  requires advanced optimization and intelligent deep learning models to meet the  demands of ultra-reliable, low-latency, and energy-efficient wireless systems. Low  Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has a vital role in enabling non-terrestrial net works (NTN), particularly in dense urban environment areas. This paper presents  a comparative analysis of hybrid optimization approaches integrating Artificial  Bee Colony (ABC), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO),  Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), and Par ticle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for  beamforming in 6G mobile radio networks. Integrated with beamforming for  6G NTN. The models are analysis using pathloss (PL),signal-to-interference plus-noise ratio (SINR), coverage area, capacity, spectral efficiency (SE), energy  efficiency (EE), bandwidth efficiency (BE), bit error rate (BER), and propaga tion delay. ABC-ELM has performed with result mean values of the PL (187.46  dB), SINR (22.62 dB), coverage area (68.03%), capacity (10.82 Gbps), SE (10.82  bits/Hz), EE (44.10%), BE (44.10%), BER (1.45−8 bps ) and propagation delay (48.65%) in urban areas. As a result, demonstrating of hybrid ELM-based opti mization integrated with beamforming is a promising approach for enabling 6G  LEO satellite networks.</p>",

      "abstract": "Accurate fluence map prediction is essential in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to maximize tumor coverage while minimizing dose to healthy tissues. Conventional optimization is time-consuming and dependent on planner expertise. This study presents a deep learning framework that accelerates fluence map generation while maintaining clinical quality. An end-to-end 3D Swin-UNETR network was trained to predict nine-beam fluence maps directly from volumetric CT images and anatomical contours using 99 prostate IMRT cases (79 for training and 20 for testing). The transformer-based model employs hierarchical self-attention to capture both local anatomical structures and long-range spatial dependencies. Predicted fluence maps were imported into the Eclipse Treatment Planning System for dose recalculation, and model performance was evaluated using beam-wise fluence correlation, spatial gamma analysis, and dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics. The proposed model achieved an average R^2 of 0.95 +/- 0.02, MAE of 0.035 +/- 0.008, and gamma passing rate of 85 +/- 10 percent (3 percent / 3 mm) on the test set, with no significant differences observed in DVH parameters between predicted and clinical plans. The Swin-UNETR framework enables fully automated, inverse-free fluence map prediction directly from anatomical inputs, enhancing spatial coherence, accuracy, and efficiency while offering a scalable and consistent solution for automated IMRT plan generation.",

This study is devoted to application of gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) for identification of six particle types which were produced in bismuth–bismuth simulated collisions at $\\sqrt {{{s}_{{NN}}}} = 9.2$ GeV. The XGBoost algorithm was compared to the $n$-sigma and blind methods, evaluating efficiency and contamination. Results show that XGBoost provides significant PID performance in momentum ranges where feature overlap limits traditional techniques, highlighting the potential of machine learning to improve MPD analyses.",

This can become a bottleneck in real-time applications, such as high-repetition-rate laser systems requiring rapid feedback and control. We present an LSTM-based surrogate model trained on SSFM simulations generated from a start-to-end model of the photocathode drive laser at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory's Linac Coherent Light Source II. The model achieves over 250x speedup while maintaining high fidelity, enabling future real-time optimization and laying the foundation for data-integrated modeling frameworks and digital twins of laser systems.",

A common complication of general anesthesia during this operation is intraoperative hypotension. In recent years, the use of preoperative ultrasound examinations to predict this condition and carry out personalized prevention has been gaining popularity. Machine learning methods trained with additional predictors\n                  </jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>can improve the accuracy of these predictions.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\n                    <jats:bold>Objective.</jats:bold>\n                    To improve the treatment outcomes of patients with prostate cancer by optimizing their volemic status in the perioperative period before robot-assisted prostatectomy.\n                  </jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\n                    <jats:bold>Materials and methods.</jats:bold>\n                    The prospective study included 64 patients scheduled for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Before surgery, patients underwent bedside ultrasound examination to determine the diameters and collapsibility indices of the inferior vena cava and subclavian veins, corrected carotid flow time (cCFT), and respiratory variation of blood flow peak velocity (ΔV). These data were used in the training of machine learning predictive models to ameliorate intraoperative hypotension prediction efficacy.\n                  </jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\n                    <jats:bold>Results.</jats:bold>\n                    The respiratory variation of blood flow peak velocity had the highest predictive value (AUROC 0.843, accuracy 75 %). The indicator’s optimal threshold for intraoperative hypotension prediction was 8.33 %. The accuracy of the prediction has been increased using the machine learning model based on gradient boosting with additional predictors (AUROC 0.933, accuracy 95 %).\n                  </jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\n                    <jats:bold>Conclusions.</jats:bold>\n                    Determining the respiratory variation of blood flow peak velocity is the most prognostically valuable indicator for intraoperative hypotension prediction during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. The use of machine learning methods to predict intraoperative hypotension increases the accuracy of prediction.\n                  </jats:p>",

Existing parameter estimation methods for VSCs have limitations including high data requirements, detachment from physical models, and difficulties in real-world implementation. To address these issues, a novel parameter estimation method for three-phase VSCs using physics-informed machine learning is proposed. This method integrates VSC physical knowledge into deep neural network training. The contributions of this work include achieving accurate parameter identification for VSCs by integrating physical models with machine learning, requiring less data and eliminating the need for external signal injection. In simulations, operating-point sweeps maintain identification errors typically at\n                    <jats:inline-formula>\n                      <jats:tex-math>\n                        \n                      </jats:tex-math>\n                      <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\">\n                        <mml:mrow>\n                          <mml:mtext>⩽</mml:mtext>\n                        </mml:mrow>\n                      </mml:math>\n                    </jats:inline-formula>\n                    3.3%.

There is a need for methods that allow inspection of reinforced concrete structures without the need for skilled engineers. The focus of this study was on electromagnetic radar which can relatively easily detect reinforcing bars and internal defects. Then, machine learning approaches, convolutional neural network (CNN) and convolutional auto encoder (CAE), were used to detect small cracks inside concrete caused by rebar corrosion from electromagnetic radar measurement data. In this study, output images from electromagnetic radar were learned and judged by machine learning. The results showed that both approaches were able to determine the presence or absence of internal cracks. The CNN determination showed the existence of cracks in the range of 0.04–1.0 mm in crack width, while the CAE determination showed the possibility of estimating crack growth.</jats:p>",

To address this, we developed and deployed a machine learning (ML) based tuning framework on the Injector 2 cyclotron at PSI, chosen as an ideal testbed for high-power operation. The system combined a tailored reinforcement learning algorithm with real-time diagnostics and control, and incorporated accelerator-physics inspired adaptations such as an overshoot strategy that reduced magnetic field settling times by nearly a factor of six. Over an extensive 12-day operational test campaign, relatively long in the context of real-time ML experiments, the ML agent successfully tuned the machine across multiple operating points, achieving convergence within hours and maintaining stable beam extraction with reduced losses. Beyond initial tuning, the system was also operated in evaluation mode overnight, where it autonomously monitored and corrected the machine to compensate for drifts, demonstrating robustness and long-term stability. Crucially, the learned policy generalized reliably from low-current training to higher-current operation, underscoring its scalability. These results constitute the first demonstration of ML-assisted tuning on a high-power cyclotron, with direct relevance to ADS-class drivers.",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract - Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) has become an important material in sustainable construction due to its ability to utilize construction and demolition waste. However, its mechanical behavior is highly variable because recycled aggregates contain adhered mortar, impurities, and irregular surface textures. These inconsistencies make the prediction of compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and flexural strength difficult using traditional empirical formulas.\nThis paper presents a machine-learning-based framework for predicting the mechanical properties of RAC using XGBoost. A curated dataset consisting of experimental and literature-based RAC mix proportions was preprocessed, analyzed, and trained to construct three predictive models. The results show that XGBoost captures nonlinear relationships effectively and delivers higher accuracy than baseline methods such as SVM and KNN. The model demonstrates strong generalization and low prediction error, proving its suitability for mix-design optimization and rapid decision-making in civil engineering.\n\nKey Words: Recycled Aggregate Concrete, XGBoost, Compressive Strength, Tensile Strength, Flexural Strength, and Machine Learning.</jats:p>",

Beyond initial tuning, the system was also operated in evaluation mode overnight, where it autonomously monitored and corrected the machine to compensate for drifts, demonstrating robustness and long-term stability. Crucially, the learned policy generalized reliably from low-current training to higher-current operation, underscoring its scalability. These results constitute the first demonstration of ML-assisted tuning on a high-power cyclotron, with direct relevance to ADS-class drivers.",

TheGigaTracker, a four-layer silicon-pixel tracker, measures the momentum and direction of incominghadron beam particles at a rate of 750 MHz. The experiment’s success relies on effectivelymanaging pile-up, temporal matching and vertex reconstruction between beam kaons and decaypions, a challenging task due to the current combinatorial track-building approach. This researchintegrates machine learning best practices in the current modeling strategies applied in the NA62 experiment. In this study, we extensively evaluate different deep learning architectures for particletracking, showing the most effective approaches. In particular, we designed and implemented threedistinct strategies based on Multi-Layer Perceptron, Transformer and Graph Neural Network. Allmethods were evaluated using efficiency, purity and fake-track rate. The most promising ones werefurther assessed in an aggregation-free setup, where clustering based on ground truth informationwas removed to test their robustness in a real-world scenario.",

Engineering System Analysis and Optimization (ESAO) is a cross‐disciplinary undergraduate course under the curricula of the Smart Construction Major. However, due to its difficulty and poor linkage to real project‐related problems, students lack interest in learning it. This study proposes developing a simulation program that is integrated into the course to improve learning effectiveness. The simulation program includes the following two models: (1) A subway station model that helps to understand the design and functions of a real subway station, the pedestrian flow in the subway station, and the evacuation pattern of pedestrians when a fire hazard occurs; (2) A road intersection model that was used to illustrate the functions of the intersection and explain how to select the optimal parameters to enhance the vehicle pass‐through rate. In order to assess the effects of the simulation program, the study used both quantitative and qualitative analyses. In the quantitative analysis, the participants were assigned to two groups: (1) the experimental group and (2) the control group by comparing their exam scores. Additionally, the qualitative analysis, including interviews and casual conversations, was adopted to attain students' opinions about the simulation program. Based on the analysis results, the simulation program has been demonstrated to increase the competence, confidence, and interest of students when compared to conventional teaching approaches.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, traditional detection methods (such as railside infrared counters and vehicle-mounted millimeterwave radars) are limited by inherent defects such as strong environmental sensitivity, high detection rate of small targets and no classification ability, making it difficult to meet the safety needs in complex scenarios. In recent years, deep learning has promoted the transition of railway obstacle detection technology to intelligence with its multimodal feature autonomous extraction and dynamic scene modeling capabilities. This review offers a thorough analysis of the historical development and advancements in railway obstacle detection methods, highlighting the transformative advances brought about by deep learningbased models, comprehensively compares the application characteristics and scenarios of various technologies, and discusses the application and evolution of deep learning in the two core tasks of target recognition and semantic segmentation, covering representative models such as convolutional neural network and Transformer. This article also uses the analysis of public data sets to help the new generation of railway obstacle detection technology to provide a theoretical basis and also facilitate researchers to quickly carry out experimental verification.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "Accurate identification of the penetration process relies heavily on prior feature values of penetration acceleration. However, these feature values are typically obtained through long simulation cycles and expensive computations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a multi-layer Perceptron architecture, termed squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP), which integrates a channel attention mechanism with residual connections to enable rapid prediction of acceleration feature values. Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances. These results validate the feasibility and engineering applicability of the proposed method and provide a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes.",

      "abstract": "Generalization across the domains is not possible without asserting a structure that constrains the unseen target domain w.r.t. the source domain. Building on causal transportability theory, we design an algorithm for zero-shot compositional generalization which relies on access to qualitative domain knowledge in form of a causal graph for intra-domain structure and discrepancies oracle for inter-domain mechanism sharing. \\textit{Circuit-TR} learns a collection of modules (i.e., local predictors) from the source data, and transport/compose them to obtain a circuit for prediction in the target domain if the causal structure licenses. Furthermore, circuit transportability enables us to design a supervised domain adaptation scheme that operates without access to an explicit causal structure, and instead uses limited target data. Our theoretical results characterize classes of few-shot learnable tasks in terms of graphical circuit transportability criteria, and connects few-shot generalizability with the established notion of circuit size complexity; controlled simulations corroborate our theoretical results.",
